Economic and monetary developments 

Overview 

At its monetary policy meeting on 13 September, the Governing Council 
concluded that the incoming information, including the September 2018 ECB 
staff projections, broadly confirms the Governing Council’s previous 
assessment of an ongoing broad-based expansion of the euro area economy 

and gradually rising inflation. The underlying strength of the economy continues to 
support the Governing Council’s confidence that the sustained convergence of 
inflation to its aim will proceed and will be maintained even after a gradual 
winding-down of the net asset purchases. At the same time, uncertainties relating to 
rising protectionism, vulnerabilities in emerging markets and financial market volatility 
have gained more prominence recently. Therefore, significant monetary policy 
stimulus is still needed to support the further build-up of domestic price pressures and 
headline inflation developments over the medium term. This support will continue to 
be provided by the net asset purchases until the end of the year, by the sizeable stock 
of acquired assets and the associated reinvestments, and by the Governing Council’s 
enhanced forward guidance on the key ECB interest rates. In any event, the 
Governing Council stands ready to adjust all of its instruments as appropriate to 
ensure that inflation continues to move towards its aim in a sustained manner. 

Economic and monetary assessment at the time of the Governing 
Council meeting of 13 September 2018 

While the global economy maintained a steady pace in the first half of 2018, 

momentum is expected to moderate. Advanced economies continue to benefit from 
accommodative monetary policies and the US fiscal stimulus, while activity among 
commodity exporters has also been bolstered by the recovery in commodity prices 
over the past year. However, financial conditions have tightened, particularly for some 
emerging markets. Moreover, global trade growth has slowed and uncertainties about 
future trading relations have risen. Over the medium term, global economic activity is 
expected to expand at a pace close to potential growth, with output gaps already 
closed or closing in most advanced economies. Global inflationary pressures are 
expected to rise slowly as spare capacity diminishes. 

In financial markets, euro area long-term risk-free rates have been broadly 
unchanged since the Governing Council’s meeting in June 2018. Sovereign bond 

spreads have been volatile against a background of sustained political uncertainty in 
Italy. Although corporate earnings remain robust, equity and bond prices of euro area 
financial corporations have declined amid geopolitical uncertainty and rising volatility 
in some emerging markets. In foreign exchange markets, the euro has broadly 
strengthened in trade-weighted terms.

The latest economic indicators and survey results confirm ongoing 
broad-based growth of the euro area economy, despite some moderation 
follow ing the strong growth performance in 2017. Euro area real GDP increased 

by 0.4%, quarter on quarter, in the second quarter of 2018, the same rate as in the 
previous quarter. The ECB’s monetary policy measures continue to underpin domestic 
demand. Private consumption is supported by ongoing employment gains, which, in 
turn, partly reflect past labour market reforms, and by rising wages. Business 
investment is fostered by the favourable financing conditions, rising corporate 
profitability and solid demand. Housing investment remains robust. In addition, the 
expansion in global activity is expected to continue, supporting euro area exports. 

The September 2018 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area 
foresee annual real GDP increasing by 2.0% in 2018, 1.8% in 2019 and 1.7% in 

2020. Compared with the June 2018 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, 
the outlook for real GDP growth has been revised down slightly for 2018 and 2019, 
mainly due to a weaker contribution from foreign demand. Although risks relating to 
rising protectionism, vulnerabilities in emerging markets and financial market volatility 
have gained more prominence recently, the risks surrounding the euro area growth 
outlook can still be assessed as broadly balanced overall. 

According to Eurostat’s flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation was 
2.0% in August 2018, down from 2.1% in July. Looking ahead, on the basis of 

current futures prices for oil, annual rates of headline inflation are likely to hover 
around current levels for the remainder of the year. While measures of underlying 
inflation remain generally muted, they have been increasing from earlier lows. 
Domestic cost pressures are strengthening and broadening amid high levels of 
capacity utilisation and tightening labour markets, which is pushing up wage growth. 
Underlying inflation is expected to pick up towards the end of the year and thereafter to 
increase gradually over the medium term, supported by the ECB’s monetary policy 
measures, the continuing economic expansion and rising wage growth. 

This assessment is also broadly reflected in the September 2018 ECB staff 
macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual HICP 
inflation at 1.7% in 2018, 2019 and 2020. The outlook for HICP inflation is 

unchanged compared with the June 2018 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic 
projections. HICP inflation excluding energy and food is projected to rise gradually 
from 1.1% in 2018 to 1.5% in 2019 and 1.8% in 2020. 

The aggregate fiscal stance for the euro area is projected to be broadly neutral 
in 2018, mildly expansionary in 2019, and broadly neutral again in 2020. Overall, 

the euro area budget deficit is expected to decline further over the projection horizon, 
mainly as a result of favourable cyclical conditions and declining interest payments. 
Although the euro area government debt-to-GDP ratio will continue to decline, it will 
remain elevated. 

Broad money (M3) growth moderated in the context of reduced monthly net 
asset purchases under the asset purchase programme (APP). M3 grew by 4.0% 

in July 2018, after 4.5% in June. Apart from some volatility in monthly flows, M3 growth 
is increasingly supported by bank credit creation. The narrow monetary aggregate M1

Overview

remained the main contributor to broad money growth. The recovery in the growth of 
loans to the private sector observed since the beginning of 2014 is proceeding. The 
annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations (NFCs) stood at 4.1% in 
July 2018, while the annual growth rate of loans to households stood at 3.0%, both 
unchanged from June. The pass-through of the monetary policy measures put in place 
since June 2014 continues to significantly support borrowing conditions for firms and 
households, access to financing – in particular for small and medium-sized 
enterprises – and credit flows across the euro area. The flow of total external financing 
to euro area NFCs increased considerably in the second quarter of 2018. 

Monetary policy decisions 

Based on the regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council 

made the follow ing decisions. First, the Governing Council decided to keep the key 
ECB interest rates unchanged and continues to expect them to remain at their present 
levels at least through the summer of 2019, and in any case for as long as necessary 
to ensure the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but 
close to, 2% over the medium term. Second, the Governing Council will continue to 
make net purchases under the APP at the current monthly pace of €30 billion until the 
end of September. After September 2018, the monthly pace of the net asset 
purchases will be reduced to €15 billion until the end of December 2018. The 
Governing Council anticipates that, subject to incoming data confirming its 
medium-term inflation outlook, net purchases will then end. Third, the Governing 
Council intends to reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased 
under the APP for an extended period of time after the end of the net asset purchases, 
and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions 
and an ample degree of monetary accommodation.

External environment 

While the global economy maintained a steady pace in the first half of 2018, 
momentum is expected to moderate amid mounting risks and uncertainties related to 
rising protectionism, vulnerabilities in emerging markets and financial market volatility. 
Advanced economies continue to benefit from accommodative monetary policies and 
the US fiscal stimulus, while activity among commodity exporters has also been 
bolstered by the recovery in commodity prices over the past year. However, financial 
conditions have tightened, particularly for some emerging markets. Moreover, global 
trade growth has slowed and uncertainties about future trading relations have risen. 
Over the medium term, global economic activity is expected to expand at a pace close 
to potential growth. Output gaps are already closed or closing in most advanced 
economies, policy support will gradually diminish and China is transitioning to a lower 
growth path. Global inflationary pressures are expected to rise slowly as spare 
capacity diminishes. Risks to global activity are skewed to the downside. 

Global economic activity and trade 

Despite mounting risks and uncertainties, the global economy continued to 
expand at a steady pace in the first half of 2018. Having moderated in the first 

quarter, activity growth rebounded strongly in the second quarter in the United States 
and Japan. GDP growth also recovered modestly in the United Kingdom. Across 
emerging market economies (EMEs), activity was supported by continued rapid 
expansion in India and China. Momentum revived in Russia in the first half of this year, 
buoyed by the rise in oil prices, but weakened in Brazil, where disruptions associated 
with strikes and political uncertainty hit confidence. 

Surveys suggest global activity momentum might moderate somewhat. Global 

manufacturing has moderated in the past few months and the global composite output 
Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) excluding the euro area declined somewhat below 
its long-term average in August (Chart 1). However, consumer confidence indicators 
remain particularly upbeat, despite the recent declines.

Notes: The latest observations are for August 2018. “Long-term average” refers to the period from January 1999 to August 2018. 

Further tariff increases and uncertainties about future trading relations are 
likely to weigh on global economic momentum going forward. In the past three 

months, the United States has enacted further tariff increases. The exemptions that 
had initially shielded the EU, Canada and Mexico from the tariff increases on steel and 
aluminium imports expired in June. Affected countries have announced retaliation 
measures. In addition, tariffs related to Section 301 of the 1974 US Trade Act – 
directed at concerns about technology transfers to China – took effect in July and 
August, affecting in total USD 50 billion of Chinese exports to the United States, and 
China retaliated with tariff increases on a similar value of US exports. Although the 
tariffs implemented so far affect a relatively small proportion of global trade, tensions 
over trade are high, which has heightened uncertainty about the outlook. Strains in 
US-Chinese trade relations remain, with the US Administration preparing a list of an 
additional USD 200 billion in imports from China to be targeted in a second round of 
tariffs, the announcement of which was imminent at the time of the September 
Governing Council meeting. 1 The United States has also initiated an investigation into 
auto sector trade to determine its national security implications. 

A mix of concerns over trade, the gradual normalisation of monetary policies in 
advanced economies, and policy uncertainties in some EMEs have led to 
heightened tensions in financial markets in recent months. The gradual 

normalisation of monetary policy in the United States has continued: following the 
interest rate hike in June 2018, the federal funds futures curve suggests that markets 
anticipate further rate hikes in the coming months. The combination of rising interest 
rates and the stronger dollar contributed to some tightening of financial conditions 
across EMEs in the early summer months. Severe tensions have been observed in 

1  Since the Governing Council meeting on 13 September, the US Administration has announced tariffs 
targeting an additional USD 200 billion of Chinese exports to the United States and China has retaliated 
by announcing tariffs on an additional USD 60 billion of exports from the United States, both effective as 
of 24 September 2018.

some EMEs, particularly Argentina and Turkey, reflecting doubts about the credibility 
of policy as well as high external financing requirements. While acute volatility has 
been limited to these countries, some spillovers to other vulnerable EMEs have been 
observed, with sovereign spreads rising and currencies coming under pressure. 

In the near term, global economic momentum is expected to moderate. 

Advanced economies continue to benefit from accommodative monetary policies. A 
sizeable fiscal stimulus in the United States will also provide an impetus to global 
growth. Moreover, higher oil prices have helped stabilise investment in many oil 
exporting economies. However, the slowdown in global trade and rising uncertainty 
about future trading relations are expected to hit confidence and investment. The 
tightening of financial conditions in some EMEs in recent months is also expected to 
weigh on global momentum. 

Over the medium term, global economic activity is expected to expand at a pace 

close to potential growth. Output gaps have already closed in many advanced 
economies. Moreover, policy support will gradually diminish. China’s transition to a 
lower growth path that is less dependent on credit and fiscal stimulus will also weigh 
on global demand. On the other hand, the stabilisation of prospects in EMEs will 
provide some support for global activity further ahead. Over the medium term, the 
pace of global expansion is expected to settle at below pre-crisis rates. 

Turning to developments across countries, in the United States activity is 

expected to remain strong this year. Tight labour market conditions, with historically 
low unemployment levels, stable participation and an upward trend on wage growth, 
should support household incomes and spending, while solid corporate profits and still 
favourable financial conditions should bolster investment. Fiscal stimulus from tax 
reforms and higher expenditure are expected to support the growth outlook this year 
and next, before fading in 2020. 

In Japan, the economic expansion is projected to decelerate gradually. While 

activity should benefit from accommodative monetary policy, waning fiscal support and 
increasingly binding capacity constraints are expected to weigh on growth. Wages are 
rising moderately amid a tightening labour market, which should support household 
spending. However, inflation is projected to remain below the Bank of Japan’s 2% 
inflation target. 

In the United Kingdom, the outlook is for moderate growth as domestic demand 

remains subdued. As inflation moderates, private consumption should be supported, 
despite the uncertain economic outlook. However, uncertainty associated with Brexit 
negotiations is expected to affect investment in the interim. 

In central and eastern European countries, GDP growth is projected to remain 

robust in the near term. Activity is supported by strong investment linked to EU 
funds, solid consumer spending and improvements in the labour market. Over the 
medium term, activity is expected to decelerate towards potential. 

Recent data suggest that activity in China is decelerating in the near term. A 

slowing housing market and the lagged effects of earlier financial tightening may

weigh on growth, while higher tariffs imposed by the United States are expected to 
weigh on trade. However, monetary accommodation and some fiscal support should 
help to sustain activity growth in the near term. Over the medium term, it is assumed 
that continued progress on structural reforms would lead to an orderly slowdown and 
some rebalancing of the Chinese economy. 

Economic activity is projected to strengthen moderately in the large 

commodity-exporting countries. In Russia, the outlook is supported by the rise in oil 
prices this year, relatively low inflation and improving business and consumer 
confidence. On the other hand, the recently imposed US sanctions are likely to weigh 
on near-term growth owing to increased political uncertainties. Over the medium term, 
economic activity is expected to expand moderately amid a challenging business 
environment, weak fixed investment and a lack of structural reforms, which is 
undermining Russia’s growth potential. In Brazil, the short-term outlook is affected by 
political uncertainties and the disruptions from strikes. However, further ahead an 
improved labour market and continuing monetary accommodation should support 
consumption, as inflationary pressures remain contained. 

Turkey is expected to undergo a difficult adjustment in the coming months. 

Rapid economic growth over the past year has led to substantial overheating. The 
recent depreciation of the currency, amid capital outflows and high inflationary 
pressures, signals a rapid deterioration in the economic environment. Indicators 
already point to a softening of activity, which is expected to deepen in the near term. 

After strong growth in 2017, global trade indicators point to a deceleration in 

the first half of this year. According to CPB data, the volume of merchandise imports 
fell by 0.4% in June (in three-month-on-three-month terms). The picture of softening 
global trade is consistent with other indicators (Chart 2).

In the near term, global trade is expected to remain subdued. Increased trade 

protectionism is expected to weigh on trade prospects. The tariffs implemented so far 
affect a relatively small proportion of global trade. However, while the direct trade 
effects of the tariff increases are small for most countries, they have heightened 
concerns about the broader outlook for trade policies and the global economy. This 
uncertainty about future trading relations is expected to hit confidence and investment, 
which will also weigh on global trade prospects. Over the medium term, global trade is 
projected to grow broadly in line with activity. 

Overall, global growth is projected to decelerate over the projection horizon. 

According to the September 2018 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, world real 
GDP growth (excluding the euro area) is expected to increase to 3.9% in 2018, before 
declining to 3.7% in 2019 and 2020. This projection path reflects the expected 
slowdown in the near term in some emerging economies, as financial conditions have 
tightened. Further ahead, expansion in advanced economies is projected to slow 
towards potential growth. At the same time, the pace of expansion in China is 
expected to moderate gradually. Growth in euro area foreign demand is forecast to 
stand at 4.1% in 2018, before declining to 3.6% in 2019 and 2020. Compared with the 
June 2018 projections, global GDP growth has been revised downwards for 2018 and 
2019, reflecting the weaker outlook in some EMEs. Growth in euro area foreign 
demand has also been revised downwards, reflecting the reduced momentum 
observed in trade data as well as the effects of weaker projected activity. 

The balance of risks for global activity is skewed to the downside. On the upside, 

the US fiscal package could have a stronger impact on activity than expected. 
However, the near-term prospects of greater trade protectionism remain high, which 
could have a significant impact on global activity and trade. Other downside risks 
relate to the possibility of a further tightening of global financial conditions, particularly 
for EMEs, disruptions associated with China’s reform process and geopolitical 
uncertainties associated, in particular, with Brexit-related risks. 

Global price developments 

Oil prices have been volatile in recent weeks. During the early summer months, oil 

prices declined as supply prospects improved with the cessation of disruptions in 
Libya and the prospect of increased supplies from OPEC and Russia. That meant that 
the oil price assumption underpinning the September ECB staff macroeconomic 
projections was about 7.5% lower in the short term than it had been in the previous 
projection. Since the cut-off date for the projections, however, the price of oil has risen 
again, reaching USD 80 per barrel on 12 September. The latest increase reflected 
market reaction to lower-than-expected crude oil inventories in the United States, 
which suggested a faster tightening of the market than had been expected. 

The past increase in oil prices has put upward pressure on global consumer 

price inflation. In the OECD area, consumer price index (CPI) inflation rose to 2.9% 
in July. Excluding food and energy, inflation increased slightly to 2.1%, extending a 
very moderate upward trend observed over the past year (Chart 3). At the same time,

despite tightening labour markets across advanced economies, wage pressures 
remain relatively subdued.

Looking ahead, global inflationary pressures are expected to remain contained. 

In the short term, the euro area’s competitors’ export prices are expected to increase 
following the recent pick up in oil prices. Further ahead, however, the current oil 
futures curve anticipates a modest decline in oil prices, implying a declining 
contribution from energy prices to global inflation. On the other hand, diminishing 
spare capacity at the global level is projected to provide some upward support for 
inflation.

Financial developments 

Since the Governing Council’s meeting in June 2018, euro area long-term risk-free 
rates have remained broadly unchanged. Sovereign bond spreads have been volatile 
against a background of sustained political uncertainty in Italy. Although corporate 
earnings remain robust, equity and bond prices of euro area financial corporations 
have declined amid geopolitical uncertainty and rising volatility in emerging markets. 
In foreign exchange markets, the euro has broadly strengthened in trade-weighted 
terms. 

Long-term yields remain broadly unchanged in the euro area and in the United 

States. During the period under review (from 14 June to 12 September), the euro area 
ten-year risk-free overnight index swap (OIS) rate and the GDP-weighted euro area 
ten-year sovereign bond yield remained unchanged at 0.75% and 1.10%, respectively. 
In the United States the ten-year government bond yield increased by 3 basis points to 
2.96%, causing its spread vis-à-vis the corresponding euro area yield to increase 
further and reach historically high levels.

market conditions remained volatile throughout the review period, with spreads of 
Italian sovereign bonds rising amid renewed tension in the market (see Chart 5). 
Government bond markets in other euro area countries have also been affected to 
different degrees. Overall, since 14 June the GDP-weighted average of ten-year 
sovereign bond yields has remained broadly unchanged, standing at 36 basis points 
on 12 September.

Broad indices of euro area equity prices corrected amid increasing geopolitical 

uncertainty. Over the review period, equity prices of euro area financial and 
non-financial corporations (NFCs) decreased by around 4% and 5%, respectively (see 
Chart 7). Euro area equity market volatility increased over the review period amid the

ongoing fluctuations in sovereign bond markets, geopolitical uncertainty and 
increasing volatility in emerging markets. Overall, a robust corporate profit outlook 
continues to support euro area equity prices, reflecting a favourable euro area 
macroeconomic environment.

Notes: The vertical grey line denotes the start of the review period on 14 June 2018. The latest observation is for 12 September 2018. 

The EONIA moved around -36 basis points over the review period. Excess 

liquidity increased by about €87 billion to around €1,909 billion. This increase is 
attributable to ongoing securities purchases under the Eurosystem’s asset purchase 
programme and a reduction in autonomous factors. 

Euro area corporate bond spreads increased over the review period. Since June, 

the spread on investment-grade NFC bonds relative to the risk-free rate has increased 
by 10 basis points to stand at 69 basis points (see Chart 8). Yields on financial sector 
debt have increased somewhat more, resulting in a spread widening of around 
12 basis points. This increase reflects a repricing of risk rather than an increase in 
default probabilities. Overall, corporate bond spreads remain significantly below the 
levels observed in March 2016, prior to the announcement and subsequent launch of 
the corporate sector purchase programme.

Notes: The vertical grey line denotes the start of the review period on 14 June 2018. The latest observation is for 12 September 2018. 

In foreign exchange markets, the euro broadly strengthened in trade-weighted 

terms (see Chart 9). Over the review period, the nominal effective exchange rate of 
the euro, measured against the currencies of 38 of the euro area’s most important 
trading partners, appreciated by 3.3%. The euro strengthened in effective terms 
despite depreciating vis-à-vis the US dollar and the Swiss franc, amid increased 
investor appetite for safe-haven currencies and the sharp depreciation of some 
emerging economy currencies. In bilateral terms, the euro weakened against the US 
dollar (by 1.2%), partly reflecting expectations about the future monetary policy stance 
of the Federal Reserve and the ECB, as well as against the Swiss franc (by 2.7%), but 
remained unchanged against the Japanese yen. By contrast, the euro broadly 
appreciated vis-à-vis the currencies of most emerging economies, including the 
Chinese renminbi (by 5.4%) and, in particular, the Turkish lira, the Brazilian real and 
the Russian rouble, which are among the currencies of emerging economies with the 
largest trade weights underlying the effective exchange rate of the euro. At the same 
time, the euro also appreciated against the British pound (by 1.5%) as well as against 
the currencies of most other non-euro area EU Member States.

Economic activity 

Despite some moderation following the strong growth performance in 2017, the latest 
economic indicators and survey results overall confirm ongoing broad-based growth in 
the euro area economy. Euro area real GDP growth is supported primarily by growth in 
private consumption and investment. The September 2018 ECB staff macroeconomic 
projections for the euro area foresee annual real GDP increasing by 2.0% in 2018, 
1.8% in 2019 and 1.7% in 2020. Compared with the June 2018 Eurosystem staff 
macroeconomic projections, the outlook for real GDP growth has been revised down 
slightly for 2018 and 2019, mainly due to a somewhat weaker contribution from foreign 
demand. 

Growth moderated in the first two quarters of 2018, but remained broad-based 

across euro area countries. Real GDP increased by 0.4%, quarter on quarter, in the 
first two quarters of this year, following average growth of 0.7% in the previous five 
quarters (see Chart 10). The slowdown in growth at the start of the year appears to 
have been related largely to weaker foreign demand while capacity constraints have 
gradually tightened. Domestic demand (notably fixed investment spending) continued 
to be the main engine of growth in the second quarter of 2018. As in the previous 
quarter, changes in inventories made a positive contribution to real GDP growth in the 
second quarter, whereas net trade made a negative contribution. On the production 
side, economic activity in the second quarter was mainly supported by robust growth 
in the services and construction sectors, while value added in industry (excluding 
construction) expanded somewhat less.

Note: The latest observations are for the second quarter of 2018. 

Employment growth remained robust in the second quarter of the year. 

Employment grew further, increasing by 0.4%, quarter on quarter, in the second 
quarter of 2018 (see Chart 11), and currently stands 2.4% above the pre-crisis peak 

ECB Economic Bulletin, Issue 6 / 2018 – Economic and monetary developments

recorded in the first quarter of 2008. The increase in employment was broadly based 
across countries and sectors. In cumulative terms, the increase in the number of 
persons employed in the euro area since the trough in employment in the second 
quarter of 2013 amounts to 9.2 million. Hours worked per person employed increased 
by 0.3% in the second quarter, following a decline in the first quarter. So far, the 
average hours worked during the recovery have remained broadly stable, primarily 
reflecting the impact of several structural factors, such as the large share of part-time 
workers in total employment and other compositional effects. 

Short-term indicators point to continuing strength in the labour market in the 

third quarter of 2018. The euro area unemployment rate stood at 8.2% in July – the 
lowest level seen since November 2008. Survey indicators have moderated 
somewhat from very high levels, but still point to continued employment growth in the 
third quarter of 2018. While indicators of labour shortages have moderated slightly in 
some sectors and countries, they remain at historically very high levels.

Notes: The Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) is expressed as a deviation from 50 divided by 10. The latest observations are for the 
second quarter of 2018 for employment, August 2018 for the PMI and July 2018 for the unemployment rate. 

Developments in private consumption continue to be driven by the recovery in 
the labour market and stronger household balance sheets. Private consumption 

rose by 0.2%, quarter on quarter, in the second quarter of 2018, following somewhat 
stronger growth in the first quarter. The latest developments in retail trade and 
passenger car registrations are broadly in line with steady consumption growth in the 
near future. From a longer-term perspective, increasing labour income is supporting 
the solid underlying momentum in consumer spending, which is also reflected in 
elevated consumer confidence. In addition, the strengthening of households’ balance 
sheets remains an important factor behind steady consumption growth, since 
households’ creditworthiness is a key determinant of their access to credit. The recent 
increases in oil prices are unlikely to significantly dent the growth of real disposable 
income and private consumption (see Box 3).

The ongoing recovery in housing markets is expected to continue to support 

growth, albeit at a softening pace. Housing investment increased by 0.8% in the 
second quarter of 2018, reflecting the continuing recovery in many euro area countries 
and in the euro area as a whole. Recent short-term indicators and survey results point 
to positive, but decelerating, momentum. Construction production in the buildings 
segment picked up again, almost reaching a seven-year high in June, when it 
increased by 0.1 percentage point compared with May and 0.3 percentage point in 
quarterly terms. The European Commission construction confidence indicators in the 
last few months point to positive, albeit softening, momentum in the third quarter of 
2018. In contrast, the Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) indicator for construction 
output dropped to 50.3 in July, the weakest pace of expansion in 21 months, but 
increased again to 51.0 in August. The housing component decreased at a stronger 
pace in the last two months. However, both the PMI indicators and confidence 
indicators remain clearly above their long-run averages. 

Business investment is expected to continue to grow, supported by favourable 
earnings expectations, accommodative financing conditions and firms’ need to 

expand their productive capacity. Business investment is expected to grow solidly, 
in line with elevated firm valuations. Earnings expectations for listed companies in the 
euro area continue to support investment, while favourable financing conditions are 
reflected in the expansion of loans to non-financial corporations. Investment is also 
rising in sectors facing capacity constraints. Indeed, manufacturers of machinery and 
equipment, for instance in the transport sector, are expanding their productive 
capacity to meet rising demand. 

Euro area exports recovered slightly, expanding by 0.6% in the second quarter 
of 2018, after the decline in the first quarter. The recovery was driven by goods 

exports and, to a lesser extent, by services (0.7% and 0.3%, respectively, quarter on 
quarter), resulting primarily from a resumption of intra-euro area exports. Extra-euro 
area exports remained subdued, with those to Asia rebounding only slightly and those 
to North America declining, which offset the strong developments seen in previous 
quarters. Looking ahead, survey indicators for global and euro area new 
manufacturing orders tend to anticipate a further moderation in export growth in the 
third quarter. 

Overall, the latest economic indicators and survey results confirm ongoing 
broad-based growth in the euro area economy. Industrial production (excluding 

construction) declined in July, albeit with mixed signals across sectors and the larger 
euro area countries. As regards survey information, the European Commission’s 
Economic Sentiment Indicator (ESI) continued to decline in July and August, but 
remains well above its long-term average. The composite output PMI stabilised 
throughout the second quarter and remained broadly stable in July and August at 
levels suggesting continued solid growth. 

The ongoing solid and broad-based economic growth is expected to continue. 

The ECB’s monetary policy measures continue to underpin domestic demand. Private 
consumption is supported by ongoing employment gains, which, in turn, partly reflect 
past labour market reforms, and by rising wages. Business investment is fostered by 
favourable financing conditions, rising corporate profitability and solid demand. 

ECB Economic Bulletin, Issue 6 / 2018 – Economic and monetary developments

Housing investment remains robust. In addition, the expansion in global activity is 
expected to continue, supporting euro area exports. 

The September 2018 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area 
foresee annual real GDP increasing by 2.0% in 2018, 1.8% in 2019 and 1.7% in 

2020 (see Chart 12). Compared with the June 2018 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic 
projections, the outlook for real GDP growth has been revised down slightly for 2018 
and 2019, mainly due to a somewhat weaker contribution from foreign demand. The 
risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook can still be assessed as broadly 
balanced. At the same time, risks relating to rising protectionism, vulnerabilities in 
emerging markets and financial volatility have gained more prominence recently.

Prices and costs 

According to Eurostat’s flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation declined 
slightly to 2.0% in August 2018, from 2.1% in July. While measures of underlying 
inflation remain generally muted, they have been increasing from earlier lows. 
Domestic cost pressures are strengthening and broadening amid high levels of 
capacity utilisation and tightening labour markets, which is pushing up wage 
growth. Looking ahead, underlying inflation is expected to pick up towards the end of 
the year and thereafter to increase gradually over the medium term, supported by the 
ECB’s monetary policy measures, the continuing economic expansion and rising wage 
growth. This assessment is also broadly reflected in the September 2018 ECB staff 
macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual HICP inflation at 
1.7% in 2018, 2019 and 2020 – unchanged from the June 2018 Eurosystem staff 
macroeconomic projections. 

Headline inflation decreased slightly in August. According to Eurostat’s flash 

estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation declined to 2.0% in August 2018, from 2.1% 
in July (see Chart 13). This reflected lower HICP inflation excluding energy and food 
(HICPX) but also lower energy inflation. Overall, however, with rates of change of 
around 9%, energy inflation continued to contribute substantially to headline inflation, 
driven by increases in oil prices over the last months as well as by base effects.

Note: The latest observations are for August 2018 (flash estimates). 

Measures of underlying inflation remained generally muted, but on a gradually 

improving path. HICP inflation excluding energy and food was 1.0% in August, down 
from 1.1% in July. Both non-energy industrial goods and services inflation contributed 
to the decrease in HICPX inflation in August. Based on the available information, the 
slight decreases are at least partially due to transitory factors such as the 
calendar-related volatility of travel-related services items or that of clothing items due 
to changes in the timing of summer sales. Looking beyond the short-term movements

from one month to the next, the range of measures of underlying inflation display an 
upward-sloping path since the lows of 2016 (see Chart 14). Looking ahead, it is likely 
that past rises in energy prices will also contribute to an increase in measures of 
underlying inflation, given the pervasive role of energy in the production of other goods 
and services. These indirect effects on inflation take longer to manifest themselves 
than the direct effect on energy items in the HICP such as transport or heating fuels, as 
they have to percolate through supply chains. 2

trimmed mean; and the weighted median of the HICP. The latest observations are for August 2018 (flash estimate) for HICP excluding 
energy and food and July 2018 for all the other measures. 

Price pressures for non-energy industrial goods in the HICP continued to 

increase gradually. While transitory factors contributed to the decrease of 
non-energy industrial goods inflation at the consumer level from 0.5% in July to 0.3% 
in August, pressures along the pricing chain continued to increase. Producer price 
inflation for non-food consumer goods rose to 0.6% in July, from 0.5% in June. This is 
the highest outturn since late 2012 and marks a continuation of the gradual pick-up 
from the lows of around 0.0% in 2016. Import price inflation became increasingly less 
negative since May 2018 and reached 0.0% in July, thus reducing the downward 
pressure from this element of the overall non-energy industrial goods pricing chain. 
For intermediate goods, further up the supply chain, producer price inflation increased 
from 3.0% in June to 3.2% in July, while import price inflation increased from 3.0% to 
3.4%. 

Recent developments in wage growth signal a continued upward trend and 
support the notion of a gradual build-up in domestic cost pressures. Annual 

growth in compensation per employee increased to 2.3% in the second quarter of 
2018, compared with 1.9% in the first quarter of 2018 and 1.8% in the fourth quarter of 
2017. Compensation per employee growth now stands considerably higher than in the

first half of 2016 (see Chart 15). Its recent increase is driven mainly by the rise in the 
annual growth of negotiated wages to 2.2% in the second quarter of 2018, up from 
1.7% in the first quarter of 2018 and 1.5% in the last two quarters of 2017. Looking 
ahead, wage agreements and the broadening of wage growth across sectors support 
the expectation of a further pick-up in wage growth. Overall, recent developments in 
wage growth are in line with improving labour market conditions, as factors that were 
weighing on wage growth, including past low inflation and the impact of labour market 
reforms implemented in some countries during the crisis, are beginning to fade.

Note: The latest observations are for the second quarter of 2018. 

Both market-based and survey-based measures of longer-term inflation 

expectations have remained stable. The five-year forward inflation-linked swap rate 
five years ahead stood at 1.69% on 12 September 2018 (see Chart 16). The forward 
profile of market-based measures of inflation expectations continues to point to a 
prolonged period of low inflation, with only a very gradual return to inflation levels 
below, but close to, 2%. The risk-neutral probability of negative average inflation over 
the next five years implied by inflation options markets is negligible and hence 
suggests that markets currently consider the risk of deflation as very low. According to 
the ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters for the third quarter of 2018, longer-term 
inflation expectations have remained stable at 1.9%.

The September 2018 ECB staff macroeconomic projections expect stable HICP 
inflation and a gradual increase in underlying inflation over the projection 

horizon. On the basis of the information available at end-August, these projections 
expect HICP inflation to average 1.7% in each year of the projection horizon, 
unchanged from the June 2018 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections (see 
Chart 17). The stable path of the annual average inflation rates conceals a decline in 
the annual rate of the energy component as the impact of the past increases in oil 
prices fades, which is offset by gradually rising underlying inflation as supply 
constraints become increasingly binding. HICP inflation excluding energy and food is 
expected to rise from 1.1% in 2018 to 1.5% in 2019 and 1.8% in 2020.

Money and credit 

In July 2018 broad money growth moderated in the context of reduced monthly net 
asset purchases under the asset purchase programme (APP). Lending to the private 
sector continued to grow without showing any signs of slowing down. Linked to this, 
there was a considerable increase in the annual flow of total external financing to 
non-financial corporations (NFCs) in the second quarter of 2018. 

Broad money growth decreased in July. The annual growth rate of M3 decreased 
to 4.0% in July 2018, compared with 4.5% in June (see Chart 18). This development in 
part reflects some volatility in recent monthly flows and base effects. Moreover, the 
reduction in net asset purchases (from €80 billion to €60 billion in April 2017, and then 
to €30 billion in January 2018) implied a smaller positive impact of the APP on M3 
growth. 3 The annual growth rate of M1, which includes the most liquid components of 
M3, again made a significant contribution to broad money growth, but moderated to 
6.9% in July (from 7.5% in June). Money growth continued to receive support from 
sustained economic growth and the low opportunity cost of holding the most liquid 
instruments in an environment of very low interest rates.

Notes: Loans are adjusted for loan sales, securitisation and notional cash pooling. The latest observation is for July 2018. 

Overnight deposits remained the main contributor to M3 growth. The annual 

growth rate of overnight deposits decreased in July to 7.5% (from 8.2% in June). 
Specifically, there was a sharp drop in the growth rate for overnight deposits held by 
non-monetary financial institutions, which tends to be rather volatile. The annual 
growth rate of overnight deposits held by NFCs declined as well, while that of 
overnight deposits held by households remained broadly unchanged. The annual 
growth rate of currency in circulation remained stable and did not indicate any 
tendency on the part of the money-holding sector to substitute deposits with cash in an 
environment of very low or negative interest rates. Short-term deposits other than

overnight deposits (i.e. M2 minus M1) continued to have a negative impact on M3, 
despite a stabilisation in the spread between the interest rates on short-term time 
deposits and overnight deposits since late 2017. Marketable instruments (i.e. M3 
minus M2) – a small component of M3 – declined further given the currently low 
remuneration of these instruments. 

Domestic sources of money creation remained the main driver of broad money 

growth (see Chart 19). From a counterpart perspective, the positive contribution to 
M3 growth from general government securities held by the Eurosystem decreased 
further (see the red parts of the bars in Chart 19), in the context of the aforementioned 
reduction in monthly net purchases under the APP. The declining contribution to M3 
growth from the Eurosystem’s asset purchases has been cushioned by a fairly steady 
and robust contribution from credit to the private sector since late 2017 (see the blue 
parts of the bars in Chart 19). This item includes both monetary financial institution 
(MFI) loans to the private sector and MFI holdings of debt securities issued by the euro 
area private non-MFI sector. As such, it also covers the provision of credit through the 
Eurosystem’s purchases of non-MFI debt securities under the corporate sector 
purchase programme. The persistent contraction in MFIs’ longer-term financial 
liabilities (excluding capital and reserves) held by non-MFI euro area residents 
contributed positively to M3 growth (included alongside other counterparts in the dark 
green parts of the bars in Chart 19). This development is related to funding substituted 
against the background of more attractive TLTRO (targeted longer-term refinancing 
operation) funds and Eurosystem covered bond purchases as part of the third covered 
bond purchase programme. Credit to general government from MFIs excluding the 
Eurosystem continued to dampen M3 growth (see the light green parts of the bars in 
Chart 19). Finally, MFIs’ net external assets (see the yellow parts of the bars in 
Chart 19) continued to weigh on annual M3 growth.

The recovery in the growth of loans to the private sector observed since the 

beginning of 2014 is proceeding. The annual growth rate of MFI loans to the private 
sector (adjusted for loan sales, securitisation and notional cash pooling) stood at 3.4% 
in July (compared with 3.5% in June; see Chart 18). Across sectors, the annual growth 
rate of loans to NFCs remained stable at 4.1% in July, having recovered significantly 
from the low level seen in the first quarter of 2014, while remaining heterogeneous 
across countries (see Chart 20). The increase in NFC lending is supported by very 
favourable financing conditions and robust growth in business investment. The annual 
growth rate of loans to households remained unchanged at 3.0% in July, in a context of 
pronounced cross-country heterogeneity (see Chart 21). Lending to households is 
supported by very favourable financing conditions, improvements in labour markets, 
mature housing markets and growth in both residential investment and private 
consumption. In addition, banks have made progress in consolidating their balance 
sheets, improving profitability and reducing non-performing loans, although the level 
of such loans has remained high in some countries.

Banks’ funding conditions remained favourable. In July euro area banks’ 

composite cost of debt financing remained broadly unchanged (see Chart 22). This 
development reflected stabilising bank bond yields and unchanged costs of deposit 
funding. Since the beginning of 2018 average bank funding costs in the euro area 
have increased. This upward movement mainly reflects developments in bank bond 
yields, which have become more heterogeneous across countries, against the 
background of increased political uncertainty. Overall, the ECB’s accommodative 
monetary policy stance, the net redemption of MFIs’ longer-term financial liabilities, 
and the strengthening of bank balance sheets continued to contribute to favourable 
bank funding conditions.

July 2018. 

Bank lending rates for NFCs and households remained close to their historical 

lows. The composite bank lending rate for NFCs (see Chart 23) decreased to 1.64% 
in July, close to the historical low of 1.62% seen in May 2018. Composite bank lending 
rates for loans to households for house purchase (see Chart 24) remained broadly 
unchanged at 1.81%, only slightly above the historical low of 1.78% observed in 
December 2016. Overall, composite bank lending rates for loans to NFCs and 
households have decreased by significantly more than market reference rates since 
the ECB’s credit easing measures were announced in June 2014. This signals an 
improvement in the pass-through of monetary policy measures to bank lending rates. 
The above-mentioned decrease in banks’ composite funding costs has supported the 
decline in composite lending rates. Between May 2014 and July 2018 composite 
lending rates on loans to NFCs and households fell by 129 basis points and 110 basis 
points respectively. The reduction in bank lending rates on NFC loans was particularly 
strong in the euro area countries that were most affected by the financial crisis, leading 
to a more homogeneous transmission of monetary policy. Over the same period, the 
spread between interest rates charged on very small loans (loans of up to 
€0.25 million) and those charged on large loans (loans of above €1 million) in the euro 
area narrowed considerably. This indicates that small and medium-sized enterprises 
have generally benefited to a greater extent from the decline in bank lending rates 
than large companies.

The latest observation is for July 2018. 

The annual flow of total external financing to euro area NFCs is estimated to 
have increased considerably in the second quarter of 2018. This primarily reflects 

a further strengthening of bank lending dynamics, supported inter alia by the 
continued easing of credit standards and a decline in the relative cost of bank lending. 
Overall, the recovery in NFCs’ external financing, observed since early 2014, has

been supported by the strengthening of economic activity, the pass-through of the 
monetary policy measures put in place (by improving borrowing conditions) and 
financing requirements related to the higher number of mergers and acquisitions. At 
the same time, NFCs’ high retained earnings have reduced the need for external 
financing. 

In the second quarter of 2018 the net issuance of debt securities by NFCs was 
more subdued than in the first quarter of 2018. In terms of monthly flows, in the 

second quarter of 2018, net issuance remained robust in April and May, but became 
negative in June as redemptions surpassed gross issuance. In terms of annual flows 
(see Chart 25), net issuance of debt securities has stabilised around the levels 
reached earlier this year, while net issuance of quoted shares continued to increase. 
Market data suggest that issuance activity in July and August was in line with historical 
seasonal patterns. Net issuance of listed shares by NFCs, by contrast, increased 
considerably in the second quarter of 2018.

Notes: Monthly figures based on a 12-month rolling period. The latest observation is for June 2018. 

NFCs’ cost of financing has remained close to the favourable levels recorded at 

the beginning of the year. In July the overall nominal cost of external financing for 
NFCs, comprising bank lending, debt issuance in the market and equity finance, stood 
at 4.4%, which is broadly unchanged compared with June 2018. In August the cost of 
financing is estimated to have remained constant. The current cost of external 
financing surpasses the historical low of July 2016 by around 37 basis points only and, 
therefore, remains lower than the level seen in mid-2014 when market expectations of 
the introduction of the public sector purchase programme began to emerge.

Fiscal developments 

The euro area budget deficit is projected to decline further over the projection horizon 
(2018-20), mainly as a result of favourable cyclical conditions and declining interest 
payments as high-cost debt continues to be replaced by new debt issued at lower 
interest rates. The aggregate fiscal stance for the euro area is expected to be broadly 
neutral in 2018 and then mildly expansionary in 2019 before returning to broadly 
neutral levels in 2020. Although the euro area government debt-to-GDP ratio will 
continue to decline, it will remain elevated. In particular the countries with high debt 
levels would benefit from additional consolidation efforts to set their public debt ratio 
firmly on a downward path. 

The euro area general government budget deficit is projected to decline further 

over the projection horizon (2018-20). Based on the September 2018 ECB staff 
macroeconomic projections, 4 the general government deficit ratio for the euro area is 
expected to fall from 1.0% of GDP in 2017 5 to 0.5% of GDP in 2020. This 
improvement is expected to be temporarily interrupted in 2019, albeit due only to 
transitory factors. The overall improvement in the fiscal outlook is mainly driven by 
favourable cyclical developments and declining interest payments. This is partly offset 
by a lower cyclically adjusted primary balance in 2019 and 2020 (see Chart 26). The 
outlook for the euro area general government deficit is broadly unchanged compared 
with the June 2018 Eurosystem projections.

The euro area fiscal stance is projected to be broadly neutral in 2018 and then

Cuts to direct taxes and social security contributions are expected to contribute to the 
slight loosening stance as a whole over the whole projection period, and particularly so 
in 2019. 

The decline in the euro area aggregate public debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to 

continue. According to the September 2018 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, 
the aggregate general government debt-to-GDP ratio in the euro area is expected to 
decline from 86.6% of GDP in 2017 7 to 80.6% of GDP in 2020. The projected 
reduction in government debt is supported by both the interest rate-growth rate 
differential and primary surpluses (see Chart 27). Deficit-debt adjustments are, 
however, expected to offset some of these effects. Compared with the June 2018 
projections, the decline in the aggregate euro area debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to be 
slightly more subdued. This is mainly due to a higher interest-growth differential which 
is only partly offset by higher primary surpluses. The debt outlook is projected to 
improve in most euro area countries, although debt levels in a few countries will 
continue to far exceed the reference value of 60% of GDP.

levels relates to financial sector support measures in several countries. Box 4 in this 
issue of the Economic Bulletin shows that, although the impact on debt from such 
support seems to have peaked, it continues to play a role. Moreover, contingent 
liabilities attributed to the financial sector remain elevated in several countries, which 
underlines the need for prudent fiscal policies going forward, as well as the importance 
of reinforcing the institutional framework in the euro area.

Macroeconomic implications of increasing protectionism 

Prepared by Allan Gloe Dizioli and Björn van Roye 

The global trading landscape has changed rapidly in recent months. 
Announcements of tariffs by the US Administration and retaliation by its trading 
partners have raised concerns about a possible “trade war” and, potentially, a 

broader reversal of globalisation. On 1 March the US Administration announced 
tariffs of 25% on imports of steel and 10% on imports of aluminium from a wide range 
of countries. The first wave of tariffs relating to technology transfers on Chinese 
imports took effect on 6 July, followed by the announcement of retaliation in kind by the 
Chinese authorities. In response to the Chinese retaliation, the US Administration 
threatened to impose additional tariffs. In parallel, the EU and Canada implemented 
retaliatory measures against the US tariffs on steel and aluminium. Finally, the US 
Administration initiated a new investigation of imports of cars, trucks and auto parts (to 
determine their effects on national security) which could result in additional tariffs. 
Recently, however, there have also been some signs of a reduction in trade tensions 
resulting from a meeting between US and EU officials as well as the new NAFTA 
arrangements between the United States and Mexico. 

This box looks at the possible impact on the global economy of a hypothetical 

escalation in trade tensions. In particular, channels through which protectionism 
might affect the economy are discussed and the potential global impact is quantified. 
This quantification relies on the ECB’s global model 8 and the IMF’s Global Integrated 
Monetary and Fiscal Model (GIMF) 9, which is a multi-country, multi-sector model. As 
with all models, the uncertainties involved mean that estimates from these scenarios 
should be treated with caution, but they can be used to provide a rough gauge of the 
channels at work. 

In the near term, the direct effects of higher trade tariffs on economic activity in 
the country imposing the tariffs depend on two main channels: the expenditure 
sw itching channel – w ith a positive impact on GDP – and the aggregate income 

channel – w ith a negative impact. On the one hand, higher import tariffs could 
reduce the purchasing power of households by decreasing real disposable incomes, 
thereby discouraging domestic consumption and investment and reducing GDP. On 
the other hand, higher prices for imported goods could induce consumers and firms to 
switch to domestically produced goods, increasing domestic demand and reducing 
imports. The relative importance of the two channels, and consequently their

domestically produced goods and imported goods. Greater substitutability would imply

that switching consumption to domestic goods is less costly for the consumer, 
rendering the expenditure switching channel stronger. However, if applied to 
intermediate goods, higher tariffs can also increase the cost of domestic production 
and lead to a delay in investments. At the same time, retaliatory trade measures can 
reduce exports and exacerbate the negative effect of trade disputes. 

Indirect negative effects arising from a deterioration in business and consumer 
confidence could amplify the impact on economic activity. The direct trade effect 

does not take into account possible additional confidence effects and financial sector 
stress stemming from increased uncertainty about future policies. Uncertainty and 
confidence effects can have a sizeable negative impact on global investment and 
economic activity. Firms’ investment decisions depend not only on current trade policy 
but also on prospective US and global trade policies. Similarly, uncertainty about 
future trade policies could affect the consumption behaviour of households. As 
concerns about the negative implications of rising protectionism increase, households 
may increase precautionary savings and postpone consumption. In addition, financial 
markets may respond to the negative real effects. A sharp change in trade policies 
could provide a catalyst for a reassessment of stock and bond prices, which would 
amplify the effects described above. 

The protectionist measures taken so far w ill have only a marginal effect on 
global economic activity, as the targeted products represent only a small part of 

world trade. The very selective measures implemented so far, such as the tariffs on 
steel (25%), aluminium (10%) and USD 50 billion of US-China trade (25%) represent 
only a small fraction of world trade. In addition, the response so far in financial markets 
and in business and consumer confidence has been contained. 

However, an escalation of trade tensions could have significant adverse global 
effects, as shown in a hypothetical scenario in which the United States raises 
tariffs on all imports by 10 percentage points and its trading partners retaliate 
with a 10 percentage points tariff increase on their US imports. 10 The direct 

channel described above is simulated in the GIMF model as an across-the-board 
imposition by the United States of 10% import tariffs on final and intermediate goods 
from all trading partners, who respond by imposing equivalent tariffs on US exports 
(but not vis-à-vis each other). It is very difficult to capture the indirect confidence 
effects of such import tariffs, so, for simplicity, it is assumed that bond premia rise by 
50 basis points and stock markets decline by two standard deviations in all countries. 
For the United States this implies a 16% fall in the stock market. Although this implies 
elevated volatility in financial markets, it is still smaller than at the peak of the global 
financial crisis (in the fourth quarter of 2008), when the S&P 500 fell by 28% and bond 
premia rose by 230 basis points. 

In our simulations, we also make some important modelling choices. First, we 

assume that the trade disputes last only two years. 11 Second, we assume that 
additional fiscal revenues generated by tariff increases are used to reduce budget 

10  The two scenarios are independent, so the 10% import tariff also applies to steel and aluminium. 
11  This modelling choice is motivated by technical considerations. By assuming temporary tariffs, we proxy 
myopic behav iour.

deficits, rather than to support demand. Third, monetary policy and exchange rates 
are assumed to react endogenously in all countries. 12 Fourth, we model confidence 
effects as changes in equity and bond risk premia. 

Finally, in all scenarios the assumed form of retaliation is critical to spillovers. 

For example, if China and the United States escalate trade disputes between 
themselves and no other country is involved, trade diversion effects come into play. In 
such a scenario, higher tariffs make US goods more expensive in China and Chinese 
goods more expensive in the United States. As a result, goods of third countries, 
which are not part of the trade dispute, gain in competitiveness vis-à-vis US goods in 
China and Chinese goods in the United States. The extent to which a third economy 
benefits from this trade diversion depends on how easily a country can substitute 
between imported products from different countries. Lower substitutability would imply 
less trade diversion. This effect also depends on whether the exchange rate moves in 
line with the model predictions. 

The trade channel 

This scenario design suggests significant negative effects on the United States. 

The direct trade channel lowers US economic activity by 1.5% in the first year (see the 
blue bars in Chart A). Lower US imports and gains in market shares by US producers 
within their home market are outweighed by lower exports. Estimation results suggest 
that the United States’ net export position would deteriorate substantially. In this 
model, US firms also invest less and hire fewer workers, which amplifies the negative 
effect on the US economy by reducing domestic demand. Gradual adjustment and 
substitution towards domestic production provides only limited compensation over 
time, and the direct trade effects of higher tariffs still imply that GDP will be 1% lower 
by the third year of the simulation. 

By contrast, in China the trade effect on GDP is initially slightly positive, 

although the gains diminish over time. In the first year of the simulation, domestic 
consumption and investment fall in China. However, these negative effects are more 
than compensated by gains in China’s net export position: the United States imports 
fewer Chinese goods, but that is cushioned by trade diversion to third countries, where 
Chinese exporters gain market share at the expense of US exporters. However, over 
time these benefits diminish: as US production adjusts in response to higher tariffs, 
demand for Chinese goods falls and Chinese GDP gains diminish. 13 

The confidence channel 

The deterioration in confidence has significant adverse effects on global 

activity. Global financial market reactions have a significant and more wide-ranging 

12  For countries in which interest rates breach the zero lower bound, negative interest rates can be 
interpreted as shadow rates, reflecting non-conventional monetary policy measures. 
13  For example, it takes some time for producers to find US suppliers for prev iously imported intermediate 
goods, or for consumers to change their habits and start buying goods produced in the United States.

impact on output across countries, with global output around 0.75% lower in the first 
year (see the yellow bars in Chart A). The tightening of financial conditions dampens 
US GDP by about 0.7% and global trade by 0.75%. Heightened uncertainty and 
weakened confidence act as a drag on Chinese activity. 14 

Taken together, this implies that real economic activity in the United States could be 
more than 2% lower than the baseline in the first year alone, and global trade could fall 
by up to 3% relative to the baseline. In a nutshell, although one may argue about the 
relative contributions of each of the channels discussed above and about the overall 
effect on economic activity, qualitatively the results are unambiguous: an economy 
imposing a tariff which prompts retaliation by other countries is clearly worse off. Its 
living standards fall and jobs are lost.

Liquidity conditions and monetary policy operations in the 
period from 3 May to 31 July 2018 

Prepared by Dimitrios Rakitzis and Mª Carmen Castillo Lozoya 

This box describes the ECB’s monetary policy operations during the third and 
fourth reserve maintenance periods of 2018, which ran from 3 May to 
19 June 2018 and from 20 June to 31 July 2018 respectively. Throughout this 

period the interest rates on the main refinancing operations (MROs), the marginal 
lending facility and the deposit facility remained unchanged at 0.00%, 0.25% and 
−0.40% respectively. 

During the review period, the Eurosystem continued to purchase public sector 
securities, covered bonds, asset-backed securities and corporate sector securities as 
part of its asset purchase programme (APP), with a target of €30 billion of purchases 
on average per month. 

Liquidity needs 

In the period under review, the average daily liquidity needs of the banking 
system, defined as the sum of net autonomous factors and reserve 
requirements, stood at €1,427.5 billion, an increase of €64.5 billion compared 
with the previous review period (i.e. the first and second maintenance periods 

of 2018). This increase in liquidity needs was almost fully attributable to an increase in 
net autonomous factors, which on average rose by €64.4 billion to €1,303.3 billion 
during the review period, while minimum reserve requirements increased on average 
by less than €0.1 billion, amounting to €124.2 billion. 

The growth in net autonomous factors, which implies absorption of liquidity, 
was a result of a decrease in liquidity-providing factors and an increase in 

liquidity-absorbing ones. The decline in liquidity-providing factors was in particular 
due to a decline in average net assets denominated in euro, which fell by €21.6 billion 
to €191.2 billion. This was mainly the result of higher Eurosystem liabilities to non-euro 
area residents in euro, which increased on average by €12.8 billion in the period under 
review, thus providing a negative contribution to average net assets denominated in 
euro, 15 and lower financial assets held by the Eurosystem for purposes other than 
monetary policy, which declined on average by €7.8 billion. On the liability side, the 
most relevant changes were driven by banknotes in circulation, which increased on 
average by €22.5 billion (reflecting to some extent seasonal patterns observed during 
the summer), and by government deposits, which increased on average by 
€11.9 billion to €239.4 billion. 

15  Eurosystem liabilities to non-euro area residents in euro mainly consist of euro-denominated deposits in 
accounts held by non-euro area central banks with the Eurosystem. Quarter-ends, and to a lesser extent 
month-ends, are typically affected by increases in these deposits, as commercial banks are more 
reluctant to accept cash, either in the unsecured or secured market, ahead of balance sheet reporting 
dates. For example, on 29 March 2018 liabilities to non-euro area residents denominated in euro 
increased to €339.8 billion, compared to an average of €270.4 billion during the second maintenance 
period, while on 30 June 2018 they increased to €348 billion, compared to an average of €279.7 billion in 
the fourth maintenance period.

The day-to-day volatility of autonomous factors remained broadly unchanged 

from the previous review period. The daily fluctuations of autonomous factors came 
primarily from government deposits and net assets denominated in euro, with higher 
volatility being observed around the June 2018 quarter-end and other month-end 
dates during the period under review.

Liquidity provided through monetary policy instruments 

The average amount of liquidity provided through open market operations – 
including both tender operations and APP purchases – increased by 
€71.3 billion to €3,291.1 billion (see Chart A). This increase was fully attributable to 

net APP purchases, while demand in tender operations decreased marginally.

was primarily due to a lower average outstanding amount of targeted longer-term 
refinancing operations (TLTROs), which decreased by €8.4 billion. The decline in 
outstanding TLTRO funds was related to the settlement of the voluntary repayments of 
various TLTRO-I operations and the first TLTRO-II operation in June 2018, which 
amounted to a total of €14.5 billion. The average liquidity provided through MROs 
increased by €0.2 billion to €1.9 billion and the average amount of liquidity provided 
through three-month longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs) fell by €0.3 billion to 
€7.4 billion. 

Liquidity provided through the Eurosystem’s monetary policy portfolios 
increased by €79.8 billion to €2,537.8 billion on average, on the back of ongoing 

net APP purchases. Liquidity provided by the public sector purchase programme, the 
third covered bond purchase programme, the asset-backed securities purchase 
programme and the corporate sector purchase programme rose on average by 
€61.8 billion, €5.7 billion, €1.7 billion and €13.5 billion respectively. The reduction in 
liquidity resulting from redemptions of bonds held under the Securities Markets 
Programme and the previous two covered bond purchase programmes totalled 
€2.9 billion. 

Excess liquidity 

As a consequence of the developments detailed above, average excess 
liquidity remained broadly stable in the period under review, increasing only 
marginally compared w ith the previous review period, by €6.8 billion to 

€1,863.5 billion (see Chart A). The increase in liquidity through the APP purchases 
was almost entirely offset by an increase in net autonomous factors, mainly in the 
fourth maintenance period. In fact, while excess liquidity grew by €50.8 billion and net 
autonomous factors declined by €9.4 billion in the third maintenance period, these 
trends were reversed in the fourth maintenance period, with excess liquidity declining 
by €55.9 billion and net autonomous factors rising by €80.6 billion. 

Regarding the allocation of excess liquidity holdings between current accounts and 
the deposit facility, average current account holdings grew by €27.3 billion to 
€1,331.9 billion, while average recourse to the deposit facility declined by a further 
€20.4 billion to €655.9 billion. 

Interest rate developments 

Overnight unsecured and secured money market rates remained close to the 
ECB deposit facility rate, or slightly below it for specific collateral baskets in the 

secured segments. In the unsecured market, the euro overnight index average 
(EONIA) averaged −0.363%, compared with an average of −0.364% in the previous 
review period. The EONIA fluctuated between a low of −0.371% around the weekend 
preceding Whit Monday (21 May 2018) and a high of −0.353% on the last day of 
June 2018. In the secured market, average overnight repo rates in the general

collateral (GC) pooling market 16 remained stable for both the standard collateral 
basket and the extended collateral basket relative to the previous review period. The 
average overnight repo rate stood at −0.441% for the standard collateral basket, while 
the average overnight repo rate for the extended collateral basket was −0.394%. 

The June 2018 quarter-end decline in repo rates for collateral from core 
euro-area countries was significantly milder than the decline at the end of the 
second quarter of 2017 and was widely perceived as a non-event. For example, 

at the end of June 2017 overnight GC repo rates for French collateral declined by 
29 basis points to −0.75% and German collateral repo rates declined by 41 basis 
points to −0.90%. At the end of June 2018 the same repo rates declined by only 
2 basis points and 5 basis points respectively, to −0.48% and −0.53%. This suggests 
that market participants have adopted more efficient practices for collateral 
management. Moreover, this development also suggests that the Eurosystem public 
sector purchase programme securities lending facility continued to support the smooth 
functioning of repo markets. 

16  The GC pooling market allows repurchase agreements to be traded on the Eurex platform against 
standardised baskets of collateral.

Oil prices, the terms of trade and private consumption 

Prepared by Nikola Bokan, Maarten Dossche and Luca Rossi 

Oil prices affect private consumption through direct and indirect channels. An 

increase in oil prices affects households’ purchasing power directly through higher 
prices for oil-based energy products (e.g. petrol, heating oil). In the euro area about 
one-third of the economy’s total oil use is in the form of final consumption, i.e. the use 
by consumers of such products (Chart A). The other two-thirds comes from oil being 
used in the production of non-energy goods. A rise in oil prices implies an increase in 
the production costs of these sectors. If these costs cannot be passed on to the final 
prices of these goods, there will be an indirect impact on households’ purchasing 
power, since either wages or profits received from these sectors will be lower. 17 
Moreover, for advanced economies that produce oil (e.g. Canada, Norway, the United 
Kingdom and the United States) the indirect effects through wages and profits from the 
oil-producing sector are even more important.

The terms of trade are highly correlated w ith oil price fluctuations. Changes in 

the relative prices of exports and imports, or the terms of trade, typically affect private 
consumption. The terms of trade can be interpreted as the amount of imported goods 
an economy can purchase per unit of exported goods. Chart B shows that the euro 
area’s terms of trade are highly correlated with oil prices. 18 When oil prices rise, the 
terms of trade deteriorate and household purchasing power falls. The strong

purchasing power of households will be affected directly, as through the consumption of oil-based energy 
products. 
18  In principle the terms of trade can also be affected by other factors (e.g. the nominal exchange rate, the 
prices of goods and services other than oil). Empirically, however, most of the variation in the euro area 
terms of trade is explained by oil prices.

correlation between oil prices and the terms of trade is widespread globally. 19 The 
correlation is typically negative for net oil importers and positive for net oil exporters. 
This relationship can change over time, as a result of either changes in the oil-intensity 
of consumption and the production of non-energy goods, or changes in oil production. 
The relationship between oil prices and consumption is thus inherently unstable.

Note: The terms of trade are calculated as the ratio of the export deflator over the import deflator. 

The impact of oil price changes on real disposable income can be proxied by 
the differential between the deflators of GDP and consumption. Chart C presents 

a decomposition of household real disposable income, i.e. the income of households 
after tax and benefits, adjusted for price changes. It uses the differential between the 
deflators of GDP and consumption to capture the impact of oil-related changes in the 
terms of trade; for the euro area, the correlation between oil prices and this differential 
is negative. The measure is theoretically well-founded and captures both the direct 
and indirect channels through which oil prices affect household real disposable 
income. 20 Even if the channels through which oil prices affect the economy change, 
this approach still shows stability in the relationship between oil-induced changes in 
purchasing power and private consumption. This is relevant in the face of changes in 
the oil-intensity of consumption and innovations in the production of oil and 
non-energy goods; for example due to higher energy efficiency or new technologies to 
produce shale oil. 21

Notes: All income components are deflated with the GDP deflator. The contribution from the terms of trade is proxied by the differential 
between the GDP and consumption deflators. Consumption and total disposable income are deflated with the consumption deflator. 

Recent oil price increases are not expected to derail the expansion of private 

consumption. While the drop in oil prices in 2014 and 2015 certainly supported the 
expansion of private consumption, the overall growth of real disposable income since 
2013 has been largely driven by labour income (Chart C). From mid-2017 to mid-2018 
oil prices increased from about USD 50 to about USD 75 per barrel. If they remain at 
their present level, the increase is unlikely to significantly dent the growth of real 
disposable income and private consumption. Moreover, oil prices are still far below the 
levels observed from 2011 to 2014. As labour markets continue to improve, private 
consumption growth is expected to remain robust. 22

The fiscal impact of financial sector support measures: 
where do we stand a decade on from the financial crisis? 

Prepared by João Domingues Semeano and Marien Ferdinandusse 

This box takes a further look at the fiscal impact of the financial sector support 
measures taken in the ten years since the financial crisis struck. W ith the euro 

area economy entering its fifth year of expansion, this seems like a good moment to 
take stock of the fiscal costs of the crisis and the extent to which the recovery has 
helped to recoup them. This is done by focusing on the measures’ impact on deficits 
and debt, and on the state guarantees granted to banks and other financial 
institutions. 23 Steps have been taken since the crisis to improve the supervision of the 
financial sector, the orderly resolution of failing financial institutions, the sustainability 
of public finances and the resilience of sovereigns, for example by establishing bodies 
like the Single Supervisory Mechanism, the Single Resolution Mechanism and the 
European Fiscal Board. 

Financial sector support measures can affect deficit and debt differently. Unless 

they are financed from cash reserves, financial sector support measures will increase 
the general government gross debt. Whether they will also affect the budget balance 
depends on whether the operation presents a clear loss for the government. 24 If so, 
they are classified as a capital transfer for statistical purposes, meaning they have an 
impact on the budget balance and debt ratio. The acquisition of financial assets above 
market price and capital injections to cover bank losses are typical examples of this. 
However, if the government receives shares in a bank or debt securities that are 
considered to be of equal value to the capital injection it provides, the support measure 
is classified as a financial operation that only affects the general government gross 
debt. The statistical reclassification of entities from the financial sector to the general 
government sector, notably reflecting the nationalisation of banks, also increases 
government debt but not the budget deficit. 

The fiscal impact of the financial sector support that euro area governments 
provided follow ing the 2008 financial crisis was large and varied greatly across 
countries, and has only partially been reversed (see Chart A). During and after 

the global financial crisis that was marked by the collapse of Lehman Brothers on 
15 September 2008, most euro area governments provided support to individual 

23  The impact of negative correlations between financial sector stability and government financing 
conditions that contributed to the sovereign debt crises in a number of euro area countries from 2010 
onwards falls beyond the scope of this box. For a description of the channels and risks of the adverse 
financial-fiscal feedback loop, see “The impact of government support to the banking sector on euro area 
public finances”, Monthly Bulletin, ECB, July 2009, and “Monetary and fiscal policy interaction in a

Note: Positive figures indicate an increase in the deficit. The impact on the deficit is net of income generated from financial support 
measures, such as dividends received on shares in financial institutions and fees received for public guarantee. 

At the euro area level, financial sector support measures had a very large 
impact on the aggregate budget deficit in 2010 (0.7% of GDP), 2012 (0.5% of 
GDP) and 2013 (0.3% of GDP) (see Chart A). Only one country, Germany, recorded 

a tangible increase in its deficit in 2008 caused by financial sector support measures; 
this number increased to six in 2009 and peaked at nine in 2012 (see Chart B). While 
declining until recently, the impact on the euro area deficit has never been zero in the 
past ten years, and 2017 saw the effect increase again due to capital transfers in Italy, 
Portugal and Cyprus. Viewed across several years, the scale of the impact was in 
many cases equal to, or even far greater than, the effect of fiscal measures taken 
during regular budget cycles. Eight countries saw a cumulative impact between 2008 
and 2017 that was higher than the euro area average, varying from an increase in the 
budget deficit of more than 4 percentage points of GDP in Spain, Austria and Latvia to 
more than 27 percentage points in Ireland (see Chart B).

sector in the EU and the United States”, Occasional Paper Series, No 117, ECB, 2010. 
26  Only four countries − Estonia, Malta, Slovakia and Finland, together representing 3% of euro area GDP − 
did not need to take any measures that affected their deficit or debt.

Notes: The chart does not include countries without support measures affecting the deficit (Estonia, Malta, Slovakia and Finland) or 
where such measures only have a marginal impact (0.1% of GDP in France in 2012). Positive figures indicate an increase in the deficit. 
The impact on the deficit is net of income generated from financial support measures, such as dividends received on shares in financial 
institutions and fees received for public guarantee. For readability, the countries are divided into two groups in order to present the same 
number of cases in each panel: the left panel excludes observations with a deficit impact below 0.4% of GDP and the right panel below 
0.1% of GDP. 

The impact on the euro area debt-to-GDP ratio, which peaked at almost 5.9% in 

2012, stood at 4.1% in 2017. The maximum impact of the support measures on the 
debt-to-GDP ratio was 10% or more in eight euro area countries (see Chart C), 
including Germany, the Netherlands, Austria and Slovenia as well as the four euro 
area countries that required an EU/IMF adjustment programme (Ireland, Greece, 
Cyprus and Portugal). The time profile of the impact of the support measures on the 
general government gross debt varies considerably. The impact has started to partially 
and slowly reverse in most countries and in the euro area as a whole, thanks to the 
income generated from the support measures, such as dividends received on shares 
in financial institutions and fees received for public guarantees, and the sale of 
financial assets. Across countries, the recovery from the support provided has been 
particularly pronounced in Ireland, where the impact of financial sector support 
measures on the debt-to-GDP ratio had declined by 30 percentage points by 2017 
compared with the peak, and also the Netherlands (ten percentage points since the 
peak), Latvia and Germany (six percentage points since the peak). However, support 
measures added to the debt in Italy, Cyprus and Portugal in 2017.

where such measures only have a marginal impact (0.6% of GDP in 2008, and 0.1% of GDP in 2012 in France). 

Euro area contingent liabilities fell from more than 8% of GDP in 2009 to 1.4% in 

2017. In most cases, the explicit guarantees that many euro area governments 
provided to individual institutions at the height of the financial crisis − or, in a few 
instances, the financing of asset management vehicles − have been phased out (see 
Chart D). This mostly represents a positive development, as a return to financial 
stability meant there was no need to renew expiring guarantees. However, some 
guarantees have been called, and receiving entities have been classified in the 
general government sector, causing the reduction in the guarantee to be matched by 
an equivalent increase in government debt and/or deficit. For example, one-fifth of the 
guarantees provided as part of the partial privatisation of the Portuguese bank Novo 
Banco in October 2017, amounting to 2% of GDP, have been called, serving to 
increase the 2018 deficit by 0.4 percentage point of GDP. Six euro area countries, 
including France, Italy and Spain, still had outstanding contingent liabilities exceeding 
1% of GDP in 2017. In addition, in July 2018 Cyprus provided guarantees for an asset 
protection scheme (APS) as part of the sale of the Cyprus Cooperative Bank (CCB). 
The APS covers potential unexpected losses on assets which have been acquired by 
the buyer of CCB, amounting to about 13% of GDP. 27 

27  These guarantees come on top of state support in the form of bond and cash placements of about 18% of 
GDP, the statistical classification of which is yet to be determined.

Slovakia and Lithuania) or where such liabilities are minimal (0.1% of GDP in Finland in 2008). Contingent liabilities refer to government 
guarantees to the banking sector. The outstanding government guarantees do not include guarantees covering retail deposits (except for 
Ireland from 30 September 2008 to 29 September 2010) or state guarantees for emergency liquidity assistance. 

The w idespread, large and long-lasting fiscal impact of financial sector support 
measures underlines the importance of further reinforcing the institutional 

framework in the euro area. As the Euro Summit on 29 June 2018 concluded, there 
is still progress to be made on the completion of the banking union and strengthening 
the European Stability Mechanism. Further work on this reform agenda, as well as 
continued efforts to safeguard fiscal sustainability, will be required to prevent future 
financial crises and mitigate the associated fiscal impact.

The global financial cycle: implications for the global 
economy and the euro area 

Prepared by Maurizio Michael Habib and Fabrizio Venditti 

As financial markets became progressively more integrated internationally over the 
past decades, economists wondered to what extent policymakers can isolate 
domestic financial conditions from external factors. This article reviews the terms of 
this debate and provides fresh evidence on the co-movement in capital flows and 
stock prices across a panel of 50 advanced and emerging economies. In particular, 
the article focuses on the relative importance of global risk and US monetary policy for 
the global financial cycle and touches upon the implications for the exchange rate 
regime. Global risk aversion emerges as a significant driver of capital flows and stock 
returns and its impact is amplified by capital account openness, but not necessarily by 
the exchange rate regime, which matters only for asset prices, not for capital flows. 
The quantitative relevance of US monetary policy and the US dollar exchange rate 
seems to be episodic. In particular, the correlation between US interest rates and 
capital flows throughout the crisis is positive, rather than negative as the theory would 
predict, indicating the need for further empirical analysis of the role of US monetary 
policy as the driver of the global financial cycle. The article also finds that financial 
market tensions have been typically synchronised between the euro area and the 
United States but that financial conditions in the two areas  have often decoupled. 
Overall, this confirms that the effectiveness of the ECB’s monetary policy has not been 
impaired by the global financial cycle.

Introduction 

Over the past decades, financial markets have become progressively more 

integrated internationally. The size of world gross external liabilities, scaled by 
domestic GDP, increased from less than 50% at the beginning of the 1990s to around 
200% at the onset of the global financial crisis in 2007. 28 The growth in cross-border 
liabilities came to a halt with the crisis, but the world today is much more financially 
integrated than 30 years ago. 29 

According to the literature, increasing financial integration has led to the 
emergence of a “global financial cycle”, strongly influenced by US monetary 

policy. While financial integration is supposed to foster risk sharing internationally, 
economists wondered whether this integration, at the same time, could cause a faster 
and more uniform transmission of shocks across several economies, leading to the 

28  The ratio is computed as the sum for available countries of nominal US dollar liabilities over the sum of 
nominal US dollar GDP.

Financial Crisis”, IMF Working Paper No 17/115, May 2017.

emergence of a global financial cycle. Rey (2015) provides a potential operational 
definition of this concept: “global financial cycles are associated with surges and 
retrenchments in capital flows, booms and busts in asset prices and crises” and are 
“characterised by large common movements in asset prices, gross flows and 
leverage”. Crucially, changes in monetary policy conditions in the centre economy, 
namely the United States, and in risk aversion globally, e.g. during the global financial 
crisis, would drive the global financial cycle, prompting swings in capital flows and 
asset prices across the globe. 30 

Such a global financial cycle, if present, would limit the potential benefits of 

financial integration. A stronger co-movement of asset prices internationally would 
drastically reduce the ability of economic agents to diversify away idiosyncratic 
shocks – i.e. country-specific ones, such as a domestic recession – through the 
acquisition of foreign assets. 31 

The existence of a global financial cycle would also have implications for 
policymakers and the choice of the exchange rate regime. According to the 

classical “trilemma” of monetary policy, if the capital account is open, it is impossible to 
run an independent monetary policy – i.e. to set the policy rate autonomously from 
that of the main centre economy, e.g. the United States – and, at the same time, have 
an exchange rate target. In this case (trilemma hypothesis), the choice of the 
exchange rate regime does matter, since a floating exchange rate would allow the 
running of an independent monetary policy. A global financial cycle would morph this 
trilemma into a dilemma for policymakers, leaving them with only two alternative 
options: (i) to keep the capital account closed, maintaining control of domestic 
financial conditions, or (ii) to open the capital account, relinquishing control of 
domestic financial conditions. Once the capital account is open, a global cycle would 
“set the tone” of domestic financial conditions – i.e. the interest rates that final 
borrowers, such as non-financial corporates and households, actually pay – 
irrespective of the ability of the domestic central bank to set the policy rate 
autonomously and the prevailing exchange rate regime. In this second case (dilemma 
hypothesis), the choice of the exchange rate regime is virtually irrelevant. 

This article provides an overview of the debate on the global financial cycle and 
offers a fresh look at the evidence supporting the existence thereof. In particular, 

the article focuses on the relative importance of global risk and US monetary policy for 
the global financial cycle. Moreover, the article also touches upon the implications of 
this cycle for policymakers when adopting the exchange rate regime. The empirical 
analysis is based on a dataset consisting of capital flows – in particular gross capital

Working Paper No 21162, May 2015, page 2. The evidence supporting the presence and economic 
significance of a global financial cycle has been challenged by a recent study by Cerutti, E., Claessens, 
S. and Rose, A. K., “How Important is the Global Financial Cycle? Evidence from Capital Flows”, IMF 
Working Paper No 17/193, September 2017. 
31  Risk sharing, that is the ability of agents to insure their consumption streams against idiosyncratic 
shocks, can occur via the “capital channel” (e.g. income on financial assets held abroad), the “fiscal 
channel” (e.g. cross-border transfers between governments) and the “credit channel” (borrowing abroad 
by individuals and governments, either in credit markets or through supranational insurance mechanisms 
such as the European Stability Mechanism). In the euro area, risk sharing takes place mainly via the 
capital channel. For a discussion, see the article entitled “Risk sharing in the euro area”, Economic 
Bulletin, Issue 3, ECB, 2018.

Is there a global financial cycle? Revisiting the evidence 

The existence of a global financial cycle rests on the validity of two distinct 
assumptions: one regarding the co-movement of capital flows and asset prices, 
and one regarding the drivers of such a co-movement. First, gross capital inflows, 

leverage of the banking sector, credit and risky asset prices share a common pattern 
over the past three decades. 33 Second, this pattern is inversely related to measures of 
global risk aversion and is driven by the US monetary policy. The purpose of this 
section is to revisit the evidence supporting the first leg of the analysis, the 
co-movement of capital flows and asset prices; the next section will elaborate on the 
evidence regarding the underlying drivers of this co-movement. 

2.1 

The co-movement of capital flows and asset prices 

Capital flows and, in particular, asset prices, to a certain extent, share a 

common pattern across countries. Table 1 reports average bilateral correlations 
across the 50 economies in the full sample and separately for advanced and emerging 
economies. For each type of capital flow or asset price, all possible bilateral 
correlation coefficients between each pair of countries are calculated over the period 
1990-2017 and then averaged, providing a simple and intuitive measure of 
co-movement. All correlations in Table 1 are positive, confirming the presence of a 
common pattern for capital flows and asset prices. 

32  The sample includes Argentina, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, 
Costa Rica, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, 
India, Indonesia, Israel, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, 
Pakistan, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Korea (Republic of), Romania, Russian Federation, Saudi 
Arabia, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, United 
Kingdom, United States and Uruguay. Similarly to other studies, the analysis focuses on “gross inflows” 
(i.e. net purchases and sales of domestic assets by foreign residents), which are crucial for assessing 
financial stability and global credit conditions. “Net flows”, which broadly mirror current account balances, 
are more relevant for assessing the sustainability of net international investment positions. As regards 
risky asset prices, the focus is on stock returns, since it is difficult to obtain other measures, such as 
corporate bond prices or mortgage rates, for a large panel of countries including emerging economies 
since the 1990s. 
33  See Passari, E. and Rey, H., “Financial Flows and the International Monetary System”, Economic 
Journal, Vol. 125, No 584, May 2015, pp. 675-698. Moreover, Jordà, O., Schularick, M., Taylor, A. M. and 
Ward, F., show that the synchronisation of credit, house prices and equity prices across countries has 
increased above real sector integration across elected advanced economies over the past 150 years. 
However, in the past three decades, it is the co-movement of the equity markets that stands out as 
particularly elevated (“Global Financial Cycles and Risk Premiums”, NBER Working Paper No 24677, 
June 2018).

Financial integration leads to a higher co-movement of asset prices w ith 

respect to capital flows. Table 1 shows that the degree of synchronicity of asset 
prices is much stronger than the one for capital flows. Under financial integration, 
international arbitrage exerts a strong pressure towards the equalisation of external 
finance premia 34, even with limited exposure to foreign assets and a substantial 
degree of home bias. 35 

The co-movement of capital flows across countries is positive, though not 

particularly elevated. Among the different types of capital flows, “other” flows (bank 
loans and trade credits) display the highest correlation (10%), in particular within the 
group of advanced economies (17%). To a large extent, this is the manifestation of 
what Bruno and Shin (2015) define as the transmission of the international “bank 
leverage cycle” (that is, the tendency of banking systems to expand balance sheets in 
good times) and of the retrenchment in capital flows – in particular risk-sensitive 
cross-border banking flows – following the global financial crisis. 36 

The co-movement of capital flows and risky asset prices increased in the 
run-up to the global financial crisis, peaking during the crisis. 37 Table 2 shows 

the average of quarterly bilateral correlations over different time periods. In particular, 
the period corresponding to the global financial crisis (2007-09) has been isolated, 
since it is known that high volatility tends to shift upwards any estimated correlation 
between two series, even if the underlying structural relationship between these two 
series has not changed. 38 W ith the exception of foreign direct investment, the 
synchronisation of capital flows and asset prices is higher in the run-up to the global 
financial crisis in the 2000s than in the 1990s. Unsurprisingly, the measured degree of 
synchronisation peaks during the global financial crisis between 2007 and 2009 when 
cross-border capital flows and stock market prices collapsed. 

34  This is the difference between the cost to a borrower of raising funds externally and the opportunity cost 
of internal funds.

The most recent period is characterised by a decline in the synchronisation of 

capital flows and asset prices. Following the global financial crisis, between 2010 
and 2017, the synchronisation of capital flows and stock prices abated, generally 
returning to a level slightly lower than in the 2000s, but higher than in the 1990s 
(Table 2, first panel). 39 The picture is not substantially different when distinguishing 
advanced economies from emerging economies. Notably, the decline in the 
co-movement of capital flows after the global financial crisis appears to be more 

39  Direct investment appears to be an exception and follows a cycle that is different from other asset 
classes. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                                    
marked among emerging economies than in advanced ones (Table 2, second and 
third panels). 

Overall, there is strong evidence of a common cycle in risky asset prices and 
some support for the presence of a common pattern in capital flows across the 

globe. The boom and bust cycle in the run-up to the global financial crisis tends to 
magnify the evidence in favour of the presence of a global financial cycle. Importantly, 
in the run-up to the global financial crisis, a global cycle is particularly evident for 
banking flows among advanced economies.

The global financial cycle: drivers and channels of 
transmission 

The economic literature has identified two main potential drivers of the global 
financial cycle: US monetary policy and global risk aversion. Figure 1 depicts in a 

stylised way the complexity of the mechanism and the channels of transmission of the 
global financial cycle. For instance, the stance of US monetary policy may affect risk 
attitude globally, but the causality may run in the opposite direction. An “unexpected” 
tightening that surprises the markets is normally associated with an increase in risk 
aversion, a decline in the price of risky assets and a widening of external finance 
premia beyond the US borders. At the same time, risk aversion shocks – e.g. those 
generated by the global financial crisis or by major geopolitical events such as war or 
terrorist attacks – may induce changes in the stance of monetary policy to counteract 
the negative effects of these shocks on the economy.

A global factor shaping the co-movement of risky asset prices is closely related 
to global risk aversion, which has been identified as one of the main drivers of 

the global financial cycle. As shown in the previous section and extensively 
documented by a growing body of literature, returns on risky assets share a common 
component that drives a non-negligible fraction of their fluctuations. According to 
Miranda-Agrippino and Rey (2018), for instance, this global factor would explain up to 
a quarter of the variance of a large cross-section of risky returns. 40 This factor would 
reflect the risk appetite of global investors and therefore would be negatively related to 
the degree of risk aversion of the market. 

A second central driver of the global financial cycle identified throughout the 
literature is the role of US monetary policy, which drives asset prices, both 

domestically and globally. Spillovers originating from US monetary policy have 
received special scrutiny in the literature, owing to the central role played by the US 
dollar in global financial markets. Indeed, around 60% of the international debt 
securities issued in the world and about as much of global cross-border loans are 
denominated in US dollars. 41 In this context, particular attention has been given to the 
role of global banks, large intermediaries with a strong presence in cross-border 
lending, which amplify the international dimensions of US monetary policy. Indeed, 
monetary policy, by changing the value of the assets in global banks’ balance sheets, 
alters both their leverage position and their willingness to take risk. For instance, a 
monetary policy expansion would boost asset prices, strengthen the capital position of 
banks and induce them to further expand their balance sheets, not only domestically 
but also through international lending. At the same time, lower interest rates compress 
safe-asset yields, inducing banks to search for higher returns by taking on more 
risks. 42 

Given its prominence in international markets, the US dollar also plays a 
catalytic role, reinforcing the transmission channels of US monetary policy to 

cross-border flows. For instance, a US monetary policy tightening would be 
associated with a rise in the value of the US dollar. In turn, the appreciation of the US 
dollar would lead to a deterioration in the balance sheet and the perceived credit risk of 
non-US borrowers with US dollar liabilities, triggering further cross-border 
retrenchment worldwide. A monetary policy loosening would have the opposite 
effect. 43 

3.1 

Global risk aversion and the global financial cycle 

The first step of the analysis focuses on the relationship between capital flows 

and global risk aversion. The literature often uses the VIX index, a measure of

implied volatility of the US stock market, as a proxy for global risk aversion. 44 
Alternative measures aimed at capturing more “global” trends have also been 
proposed. For instance, Miranda-Agrippino and Rey find that the common component 
of a large panel of returns on risky assets traded on all the major global markets 
(i) co-moves with the VIX and the US Baa-Aaa spread and (ii) is strongly correlated 
with measures of implied stock price volatility in Europe (VSTOXX and VFTSE). 
Hence, rather than solely relying on the VIX, this analysis also uses a Global Stock 
Market Factor, constructed from stock returns for 63 countries (see Box 2 for details of 
the methodology). Both indicators, the VIX and the Global Stock Market Factor, should 
capture uncertainty about the future – as measured by the realised volatility of the 
markets – and the degree of risk aversion of the markets. 45 Compared with the VIX, 
the Global Stock Market Factor should better capture global developments. 

Capital flows soared at the start of the new millennium, as both the VIX and the 
global factors declined, and collapsed during the global financial crisis in 

2008-09, as risk aversion mounted. Chart 1a shows the development of capital 
flows, aggregated across all four categories and, separately, for advanced economies 
and for emerging economies against the VIX (inverted scale). Chart 1b displays 
aggregate capital flows against the Global Stock Market Factor (inverted scale). In 
both charts the co-movement of capital flows and proxies of risk aversion in the run-up 
to the global financial crisis and immediately afterwards is particularly evident. 
Importantly, it should be noted that between the early 2000s and 2009, there is an 
upward trend in capital inflows both for advanced and (to a lesser extent) for emerging 
economies. The process of financial integration is truly global. 

Outside the crisis period, the relationship between capital flows and global risk 
is weaker than in the first decade of the 2000s, in particular when using the VIX 

index as a gauge of risk. Both Chart 1a and Chart 1b display a less marked pattern 
of co-movement of capital flows and the two proxies of global risk in the 1990s and 
since 2010 when the major central banks introduced quantitative easing measures 
that contributed to a decline in market volatility. This is confirmed by the correlation of 
these series over the whole sample and across three different decades, shown in 
Table 3. The correlation of the Global Stock Market Factor with global capital flows to 
either advanced economies (-0.61) or emerging economies (−0.51) is much tighter 
and more stable than the one of the VIX index (around -0.3). Notably, the negative 
relationship between the VIX and global capital flows is not present since 2010. 

44  See for instance Habib, M. M. and Stracca, L. (2012) for an application to currencies (“Getting beyond 
carry trade: What makes a safe haven currency?”, Journal of International Economics, Vol. 87, Issue 1, 
May 2012, pp. 50-64). The choice of the VIX can be justified on three grounds. First, implied volatility is 
strongly correlated across countries so that even country-specific variables mostly capture global trends. 
Second, the US stock market plays a central role in global financial markets owing to the importance of 
the US dollar. Third, the VIX is available for a long time span.

Notes: The latest observation is for the fourth quarter of 2017. Capital flows are reported as a share of the country group’s GDP, 
i.e. capital flows to advanced economies divided by the sum of advanced economies’ GDP, and similarly for emerging economies. The 
Global Stock Market Factor is constructed from stock returns for 63 countries (see Box 2 for details of the methodology). 

A formal econometric analysis confirms that a Global Stock Market Factor 
shares a tight relationship with capital flows across different asset categories. 

The relationship between capital flows, stock market returns and several different 
measures of global risk is investigated empirically in a panel setting, including 
variables controlling for the influence of domestic (“pull”) factors for capital flows. The 
results confirm that a global financial cycle in capital flows is strongly connected to 
measures of risk in global stock markets (see Box 1).

As mentioned in the introduction, the global financial cycle could limit the ability of 
policymakers to isolate domestic financial conditions. Even when adopting a flexible 
exchange rate regime – which allows for some independence in setting policy rates 
according to existing evidence 46 – a global risk shock would be transmitted across the 
globe to capital flows and risky asset prices, irrespective of the prevailing exchange

The econometric evidence partly supports the presence of a dilemma in the 
transmission of global risk to capital flows and stock markets (see Box 1). 

Indeed, the analysis shows that global risk affects capital flows in those economies 
that have liberalised the capital account, as predicted by the theory. At first sight, the 
exchange rate regime does not seem to matter in the transmission of global risk. The 
irrelevance of the exchange rate regime is consistent with the existence of a dilemma, 
not a trilemma, in the presence of a global financial cycle. However, when restricting 
the sample to those economies that have a liberalised capital account, a rigid 
exchange rate regime appears to facilitate a stronger transmission of global risk to 
stock markets, providing support to the traditional view of the trilemma in international 
economies, where floating rates allow for a degree of freedom in facing external 
shocks. 

Box 1 

The transmission of global risk factors and the policy trilemma 

Prepared by Maurizio Michael Habib 

The transmission of global risk to capital flows and stock prices is studied in a simple panel 
regression across a sample of 50 economies. The model is the follow ing: 

𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖 + 𝑏𝑏𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 + 𝑐𝑐𝑍𝑍̅𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 

where Yit, the dependent variable, is one of the four main categories of capital flows – direct 
investment, portfolio equity, portfolio debt or other flows – or stock returns in country i at time (quarter) 
t. The coefficient ai captures country-specific fixed effects that do not vary across time; Zit is a vector 
of domestic control variables that can affect capital flows and returns, including domestic inflation and 
real GDP growth; and, finally, Xt is a proxy of global risk and eit is an error term. 47 Alternatively, two 
different proxies of risk have been included: the VIX and the Global Stock Market Factor. 

Table A presents the results of these regressions for two different models, one including the 
VIX (model 1) and one using the Global Stock Market Factor (model 2). The coefficients of the 

control variables are omitted for space reasons. As expected, most of the coefficients are negative, 
suggesting that when global risk rises, cross-border capital flows and risky asset prices decline 
around the world. Zooming into different types of capital flows, direct investment emerges to be less 
sensitive to global risk, since the decision to invest abroad is based on long-run expectations of 
profitability. Among the various proxies of risk, the Global Stock Market Factor is the indicator most 
closely connected to capital flows and stock prices, since the coefficient is statistically significant for 
all types of flows and the regression displays the best goodness of fit. 48 However, the ability of the 
model to capture the volatility of capital flows – particularly high at the quarterly frequency – is very 
limited, as shown by the reported R-squared. For stock returns, instead, the change in the Global 
Stock Market Factor has a good fit and explains one-third of the variation of the stock returns. Overall, 
this simple model confirms that a global financial cycle in capital flows and asset prices is negatively 
associated with global risk. 

47  The model is estimated with a Driscoll-Kraay estimator accounting for cross-sectional and temporal 
dependence of the residuals. The results are robust to the inclusion of different lags of the dependent 
variable. 
48  For consistency with how it is constructed, the Global Stock Market Factor enters the equation for equity 
returns in first differences.

An extension of the model makes it possible to consider an interesting policy angle: the role 
of capital account openness and the exchange rate regime in the transmission of risk to 

capital flows and risky asset prices. According to the new “dilemma” in international finance, once 
the capital account is open, a floating exchange rate cannot isolate the domestic economy from the 
transmission of shocks driving the global financial cycle, such as risk aversion shocks. To test this 
hypothesis, the model is augmented with two dummies distinguishing countries with a higher than 
average degree of capital account openness (Open) from those that are more closed, and countries 
with a fixed exchange rate regime (Peg) from those with a floating regime. 49 These dummies are 
interacted with the global risk factor to control if the transmission of risk shocks is stronger among 
countries with a fixed exchange rate (trilemma hypothesis) or not (dilemma). Among the risk factors, 
the Global Stock Market Factor has been selected, since it performed better in the first stage of the 
analysis compared with the VIX. 

49  Capital account openness is measured using the de jure index developed by Chinn, M. D. and Ito, H., 
“What Matters for Financial Development? Capital Controls, Institutions, and Interactions”, Journal of 
Development Economics, Vol. 81, Issue 1, October 2006, pp. 163-192. The exchange rate regime 
classification is based on Ilzetzki, E., Reinhart, C. M. and Rogoff, K. S., “Exchange Arrangements

10% level, respectively. 

Table B summarises the results, focusing on the global risk factor and its interaction w ith the 
dummies, omitting other controls. A negative coefficient for the interaction term of global risk 
with a specific characteristic (e.g. Open or Peg) suggests that the countries possessing that 

feature are more affected by global risk. First, as expected, the transmission of global risk to 
capital flows and asset prices is stronger among those economies with a more open capital account, 
in particular for direct investment, portfolio debt and other investment (e.g. bank loans), as the 
interaction term is negative and statistically significant. Second, at first sight, the exchange rate does 
not seem to matter. Even though the coefficient of the dummy for countries pegging their currency 
interacted with global risk is negative, the statistical significance is weak. This provides support to the 
new theory of the global financial cycle that stresses the limited ability of a floating rate to shield 
domestic financial conditions from the global ones. It is possible to qualify this result, analysing a finer 
partition of the sample. Focusing on the countries that are relatively more open – those potentially 
more exposed to the global financial cycle – the transmission of global risk to stock prices is higher 
among pegs than for floaters, supporting the traditional trilemma hypothesis. 

Summing up, global risk aversion emerges as a significant driver of capital flows and stock 
returns and its impact is amplified by capital account openness, but not necessarily by the 
exchange rate regime, which matters only for asset prices when the capital account is open, 
not for capital flows.

US monetary policy and the global financial cycle 

Empirically, there is a broad consensus that monetary policy actions of large 
central banks, such as the Federal Reserve System, spill over to global 

financial markets. A wealth of studies have shown that monetary policy decisions by 
the Federal Reserve have an impact on capital flows, exchange rates and the 
international co-movement of asset prices. These papers generally find that a 
tightening of US monetary policy significantly influences foreign economies via an 
increase of foreign long-term interest rates and a depreciation of their currencies 
against the US dollar. Furthermore, the transmission to foreign long-term rates is 
mostly attributable to effects on term premia. 50 

However, there does not seem to be a stable relationship between the US policy 
rate, the value of the US dollar and global capital flows. Chart 2a and Table 3 

show that the US interest rate – specifically the effective federal funds rate extended 
with the Wu-Xia shadow rate 51 during the zero lower bound period – is generally 
uncorrelated with global capital flows, with the exception of the crisis. In the 2000s, the 
correlation of US interest rates with capital flows is positive – not negative as 
expected – and the correlation with indicators of risk aversion such as the VIX is 
negative – not positive as expected. In the run-up to the global financial crisis, US 
interest rates increased in tandem with cross-border capital flows and when the global 
financial crisis erupted, the Federal Reserve was forced to ease monetary policy. 

The value of the US dollar is negatively correlated w ith capital flows, even 
though the relationship is clearly driven by the cycle in the run-up to the global 

financial crisis. Chart 2b shows that the nominal effective exchange rate of the US 
dollar depreciated from 2002 to the onset of the global financial crisis in the autumn of 
2008. During this period, capital flows were on an upward trend among advanced and 
emerging economies. The crisis signals a turning point for both the US dollar, which 
appreciates sharply, and capital flows, which retrench dramatically. However, outside 
the period 2000-09, the relationship is less stable. Table 3 reports the correlation of the 
value of the US dollar – taken in log changes to avoid issues of stationarity in the 
series – with capital flows, confirming a tight negative relationship between 2000 and 
2009 – a correlation coefficient ranging between -0.43 for advanced economies 
and -0.49 for emerging ones – and a looser connection in the 1990s for both advanced 
and emerging economies and since 2010 for advanced economies. 52 Possibly, the 
impact of monetary policy and the role of the US dollar on the global financial cycle

52  Over the past few years, the relationship between capital flows and the US dollar has remained 
significantly negative for emerging markets. This outcome may be explained by the increased 
attractiveness of the US dollar as a safe haven since the start of the global financial crisis. It is possible to 
note that the value of the dollar is positively correlated with risk factors (around 0.2) since 2010, but not in 
the 1990s.

Notes: The latest observation is for the fourth quarter of 2017. Capital flows are reported as a share of the country group’s GDP, 
i.e. capital flows to advanced economies divided by the sum of advanced economies’ GDP, and similarly for emerging economies. US 
policy rate refers to the effective federal funds rate extended with the Wu-Xia shadow rate. Nominal USD exchange rate refers to the 
nominal broad trade-weighted exchange value of the US dollar, where an increase in the index denotes an appreciation (note the 
inverted scale in Chart 2b). 

53  Replacing the level of US interest rates with US monetary policy shocks identified with high-frequency 
data or an index of US monetary policy uncertainty does not substantially alter these findings. In a 
dynamic panel setting similar to the one introduced in Box 1, distinguishing between different types of 
capital and controlling for pull factors, US monetary policy shocks are negatively related to portfolio equity 
flows and stock returns, but not to other types of capital flows.

3.3 

Summary of the empirical evidence 

Overall, the evidence reviewed here suggests that capital flows and risky asset 
prices have been influenced by global risk factors in the past decades. This 

influence is particularly evident in the period preceding the global financial crisis and in 
its immediate aftermath. Notably, the most recent period has instead been 
characterised by a loosening of the cycle. Moreover, the exchange rate regime does 
not seem to matter for the transmission of the cycle, with the possible exception of 
risky asset prices when the capital account is open. 

While the central role of US monetary policy and the presence of a US dollar 
cycle connected to the global financial cycle is a concept well entrenched 
among economists, more work is needed to pin down the economic 
significance of these drivers of the financial cycle for the global economy. In 

different terms, while the existence of a causal nexus between US monetary policy 
and capital flows cannot be excluded, the quantitative relevance of changes in US 
interest rates for international capital flows appears limited and would have to be 
ascertained. This implies that the risks for global capital flows and risky asset prices of 
a gradual, well-communicated normalisation of US monetary policy should not be 
exaggerated. 54

Implications for the euro area 

The euro area is not an island: product and financial market openness make the 
euro naturally exposed to changes in global financial conditions. In the previous 

sections, a connection between, on the one hand, global risk aversion and, on the 
other hand, capital flows and stock returns has been outlined. This section delves into 
the implications of the observed co-movement in asset prices for euro area financial 
conditions. The transmission of global shocks to the euro area economy is amplified 
by the presence of large, global euro area banks that play a central role in international 
lending. Due to its size and interconnectedness, however, the euro area is not only a 
receiver but also a generator of shocks that affect the global financial cycle. 55 

Given the prominence of the US economy in driving the financial cycle, it is 
interesting to focus on the relationship between US and euro area financial 

conditions. This can be done using composite “financial condition indices” that 
assemble information from a small set of financial variables. 56 We look at two such 

54  See the speech by the Federal Reserve Chairman J. H. Powell entitled “Monetary Policy Influences on 
Global Financial Conditions and International Capital Flows” at “Challenges for Monetary Policy and the 
GFSN in an Evolv ing Global Economy”, Eighth High-Level Conference on the International Monetary 
System sponsored by the International Monetary Fund and the Swiss National Bank, Zurich, Switzerland, 
8 May 2018. 
55  For instance, recent analyses show that the ECB’s asset purchase programme (APP) has triggered 
substantial capital flows across borders, favouring a substantial portfolio adjustment towards foreign 
sovereign bonds and increasing the average maturity of bonds in the portfolios. Also, APP 
announcements have caused a broad-based depreciation of the euro and boosted equity prices around 
the world; see “The international dimension of the ECB’s asset purchase programme”, speech by Benoît 
Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the Foreign Exchange Contact Group meeting, 
11 July 2017. 
56  See, for instance, “Financial conditions and growth at risk”, Global Financial Stability Report, IMF, 
October 2017, Chapter 3.

indices, which convey slightly different information. The first index, computed by 
Goldman Sachs, gives a relatively large weight to the level of interest rates paid by 
sovereigns and corporates and also takes into account the tightening effects of 
exchange rate appreciations. 57 The second index, computed by Bloomberg, assigns 
more importance to interest rate spreads, as well as realised volatilities in bond, stock 
and money markets. Furthermore, it does not include exchange rates. It is therefore 
more indicative of rising financial turbulence, as gauged by time-varying risk premia. 58 
In other words, the prominence given by the latter index to spreads and volatilities 
implies that it is more sensitive to temporary financial tensions. Although both indices 
are defined as measures of financial conditions, for the sake of exposition we will refer 
to them in the rest of the discussion as indices of financial conditions and financial 
tensions, respectively. 

The degree of synchronisation of financial conditions between the United 
States and the euro area is overall tenuous and changes over time, also 
reflecting differences in the monetary policy stance. Chart 3a shows the index of 

financial conditions for the United States and for the euro area between 2000 and 
2018. 59 In the case of the United States, three distinct periods of financial tightening 
can be identified. The first, between 2001 and 2003, coincides with the bursting of the 
dot-com bubble in the US stock market. The second follows the bankruptcy of Lehman 
Brothers. The third, from the middle of 2014 to the beginning of 2016, is largely driven 
by an appreciation of the dollar. The timeline for the euro area is characterised by two 
important differences. First, the impact of the 2001 US recession is very muted. 
Second, the tightening of financial conditions during the Great Recession (2008-09) is 
much more gradual and less pronounced. These differences show up in notably 
different correlations across time periods. Before the financial crisis, the correlation in 
financial conditions is mildly positive (0.33); it increases during the crisis 
(0.71 between 2007 and 2012); and from July 2012 onwards it turns negative. 60 The 
change in sign reflects the progressive loosening of financial conditions in the euro 
area, also thanks to monetary policy accommodation and the relative stability (bar the 
temporary tightening of financial conditions between 2014 and 2016) in the United 
States. 

57  The index, computed by Goldman Sachs, is a weighted average of a short-term interest rate, a long-term 
riskless bond yield, a corporate credit spread, the ratio of an equity index to a lagged ten-year average of 
earnings per share, and a trade-weighted exchange rate. In the case of the euro area, the index also 
includes a measure of fragmentation, i.e. a sovereign credit spread. It assigns to the different indicators a 
weight that reflects their predictive content for GDP four quarters ahead which is also inversely related to 
their standard deviation. 
58  The indices are computed by Bloomberg. The index for the United States includes: (i) for money market 
rates, the TED spread, the LIBOR/OIS spread and the commercial paper/T-bill spread; (ii) for the bond 
market, the Baa corporate/Treasury spread, the municipal/Treasury spread, the high-yield Treasury 
spread and the swaption volatility index; and (iii) for the stock market, the VIX and the deviation of 
Standard & Poor ’s share prices from their five-year moving average. All the components are aggregated 
using equal weights. For the euro area, the index includes: (i) for money market rates, the euro TED 
spread and the EURIBOR/OIS spread; (ii) for the bond market, the JP Morgan High Yield Europe Index 
and the EU ten-year swap spread; and (iii) the deviation of EURO STOXX share prices from their 
five-year moving average, the VDAX-NEW index and de-trended share prices. 
59  The indicators are in deviations from a historical mean and standardised, so that periods in which they 
are positive (negative) indicate financial conditions being tight (loose) relative to their mean level. 
60  July 2012 is taken as the cut-off period to account for changes in market expectations about the 
likelihood of the ECB adopting unconventional monetary policy measures following the speech given by 
Mario Draghi, President of the ECB, at the Global Investment Conference in London on 26 July 2012.

The co-movement in financial tensions is instead very strong. Chart 3b shows 

the two indices of financial tensions for the United States and for the euro area. It is 
evident that financial tensions are, most of the time, dormant. However, when they 
manifest themselves (in 2008 both in the United States and in the euro area and in 
2011 mainly in the euro area) they have a large impact on the real economy, possibly 
generating non-linear effects. Overall, the correlation between the two indices is 
strong and stable (ranging between 0.8 and 0.9), suggesting that (i) financial tensions 
are triggered by movements in global risk and (ii) risk premia both in the United States 
and in the euro area are heavily influenced by this common component (see Box 2). 61 

Overall, two key messages emerge from this analysis. First, financial conditions in 

the euro area evolve largely independently from global forces, also thanks to the ability 
of monetary policy to steer expected rates on safe assets and term premia in the 
desired direction. Second, credit spreads and realised volatilities in the United States 
and in the euro area are highly synchronised, reflecting the global nature of risk 
appetite in closely financially integrated markets. 

61  An interesting observation is that the crisis that originated in the United States in 2008 had a stronger 
impact on the euro area than the euro area sovereign debt crisis had on the United States. While more 
refined analyses would be needed to ascertain the strength of the respective causal effects, it is plausible 
that the strong activ ity of euro area banks in the United States amplified the effects of the US crisis on the 
euro area economy.

The global financial cycle: is the euro area special? 

Prepared by Fabrizio Venditti 

This box documents how the Global Stock Market Factor is computed and explores its 
relative importance for euro area stock returns. A dynamic factor model for stock returns in 

63 countries is estimated. The first common factor is the Global Stock Market Factor. 62 Once this 
factor is estimated, its relevance for the individual indicators can be assessed through simple 
variance decomposition. More formally, for each country “i” at time “t” we have: 

yi,t = θi ft + εi,t 

62  The methodology follows Miranda-Agrippino and Rey (2015). Nevertheless, this exercise uses only 
national averages of equity returns and does not consider the prices of risky bonds.

where yi,t is either stock returns or cross-border flows, ft is a common factor, and εi,t is an 
across countries. Since ft and εi,t are uncorrelated, we can estimate the share of variance of yi,t 
idiosyncratic component (with variance σi2 ) that accounts for the part of yi,t that is not common 
accounted for by the common factor as θi2
θi2+σi2 . Estimation is carried out on a set of 63 countries, 
comprising advanced and emerging economies. 

Chart A shows the estimated share of variance accounted for by the Global Stock Market 
Factor in the 63 countries considered. Two results stand out. First, commonality is very 

heterogeneous across countries. Second, the relevance that the global factor has for the equity 
returns of euro area countries (dark blue bars) and the United States (yellow bar) is overall 
comparable, indicating that global shocks are an important factor in shaping both euro area and US 
equity price movements.

Concluding remarks 

Real economy and financial market integration over the past decades has 
influenced the synchronisation of capital flows and asset prices across the 

world. Some authors have advocated the existence of a global financial cycle that 
manifests itself through the co-movement of cross-border flows and translates into 
more aligned risky asset prices and external finance premia across different 
economies. This was the case in the run-up to the global financial crisis and in its 
aftermath, in particular for cross-border banking flows among advanced economies 
and for stock prices. However, after the crisis, the synchronisation of capital flows and 
stock prices has abated, returning to the levels observed between the 1990s and the 
2000s. 

The global financial cycle is closely connected to global risk factors. A measure 

of global risk aversion (constructed as the common factor that drives a panel of equity 
returns) has a significant impact on capital flows and stock returns. Moreover, capital 
account openness – but not necessarily the exchange rate regime – amplifies the 
effects of global risk aversion. The exchange rate regime matters only for the 
transmission of global risk to asset prices when the capital account is open. The 
impact of US interest rates and the US dollar exchange rate on capital flows, instead, 
appears to be episodic. 

The influence of the global financial cycle on the euro area depends on the 

particular measure that is analysed. The article finds that financial market tensions 
have typically been synchronised between the two areas. Bouts of volatility, which can 
have strong non-linear effects on economic activity, are quickly transmitted from one 
economy to the other. However, financial conditions  in the euro area have often 
decoupled from those in the United States, also owing to differences in the monetary 
policy stance. Overall, this confirms that the effectiveness of the ECB’s monetary 
policy has not been impaired by the global financial cycle.

Interpreting recent developments in market-based 
indicators of longer-term inflation expectations 

Prepared by Benjamin Böninghausen, Gregory Kidd and Rupert 
de Vincent-Humphreys 

Private sector inflation expectations are a key component of a broad range of 
indicators that the ECB considers when determining the appropriate monetary policy 
stance for achieving its price stability objective. Inflation expectations can not only 
affect inflation itself through the wage and price-setting processes, but also serve as a 
useful cross-check on the ECB’s and the Eurosystem’s own projections. 

This article focuses on market-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations, 
which are timely indicators derived from the prices of instruments that are traded in 
financial markets and linked to future inflation outcomes. It reviews recent 
developments in the information that can be extracted from different types of 
market-based indicator, starting from the period leading up to the ECB’s 
announcement of its expanded asset purchase programme (APP). 

The fall in market-based indicators of longer-term inflation expectations between 2014 
and mid-2016 was consistent across major jurisdictions, possibly reflecting global 
concerns about weak aggregate demand and associated disinflationary pressures. 
Their subsequent recovery has been driven by a partial dissipation of these concerns 
and, in particular, a significant improvement in the euro area macroeconomic 
environment. The lion’s share of the movement in longer-term inflation expectations 
over the past few years has stemmed from the inflation risk component of these 
indicators, suggesting that the balance of risks to the inflation outlook has been one of 
the main drivers. Indeed, information extracted from the prices of inflation options 
implies that the risk-neutral probability of deflation increased noticeably in late 2014 
and early 2015, before declining more recently.

Introduction 

Inflation expectations play a central role in the ECB’s monetary policy, as its 
primary and overriding objective is to maintain price stability in the euro area. In 

1998 the ECB’s Governing Council defined price stability as a year-on-year increase in 
the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for the euro area of below 2%. In 
2003 it then clarified that in the pursuit of price stability it aims to maintain inflation 
rates at levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. In this context, private 
agents’ inflation expectations serve two main purposes in the conduct of monetary 
policy. First, inflation expectations are relevant in their own right in that they influence 
private agents’ economic decisions in areas such as consumption and investment, as 
well as wage and price setting, and thus euro area inflation. Similarly, financial market 
participants’ inflation expectations are relevant in the pricing of other financial 
instruments, such as nominal bonds, and can thus directly affect the transmission of 
monetary policy to the real economy. Second, they serve as a valuable cross-check on

Interpreting recent developments in market-based indicators of longer-term inflation 
expectations 

73 

 
the inflation outlook in the Eurosystem/ECB staff macroeconomic projections, which in 
turn inform the ECB’s monetary policy decisions. 

The ECB therefore closely monitors private agents’ inflation expectations in the 
form of both survey-based and market-based measures. Survey-based measures 

reflect future inflation expectations, as expressed directly in the context of regular 
expert surveys conducted on a monthly or quarterly basis. One such survey that plays 
a prominent role in the ECB’s monetary policymaking is its own Survey of Professional 
Forecasters (SPF), a quarterly survey of experts affiliated with financial and 
non-financial institutions based in the European Union. By contrast, market-based 
measures reflect the information derivable from the prices of financial instruments, 
such as inflation-linked swaps (ILSs), inflation-linked bonds or inflation options, which 
are linked to future inflation outcomes. Since such financial instruments are traded 
continuously, market-based measures not only provide additional valuable information 
on the inflation expectations of informed investors, but can also give more timely 
indications of potential shifts in the inflation outlook. Furthermore, they embody not 
only the inflation expectation, but also a premium related to inflation uncertainty, which 
can vary over time. Despite these differences, both survey-based and market-based 
indicators of inflation expectations are part of a broad range of indicators that the ECB 
considers in its monetary policy decision-making. 

This article reviews recent developments in market-based measures of euro 
area inflation expectations, in particular the shift in the balance of risks to the 

inflation outlook since 2014. Following on from an earlier review of market-based 
indicators of euro area inflation that covered the impact of the global financial crisis, 63 
the present article examines both the phase of weakening inflation dynamics in the 
run-up to the ECB’s launch of the APP as a (further) non-standard monetary policy 
measure and the evolution of market-based measures of inflation expectations 
thereafter. Section 2 of the article explores the drivers of market-based indicators of 
inflation expectations over the two aforementioned periods, also drawing on a 
model-based analysis. Section 3 focuses on one of the main drivers, namely the shift 
in the balance of risks to the inflation outlook, which is inferred from information 
derived from option prices, and corroborated by information extracted from the ECB 
SPF. Box 1 sheds some light on the conclusions drawn in Section 3 by highlighting the 
important difference between risk-neutral and “physical” probabilities.

Review of recent developments in market-based measures 
of inflation expectations and their drivers 

This section reviews recent developments in investors’ longer-term inflation 
expectations by analysing the evolution of inflation-linked swap (ILS) rates. An 

ILS is a derivative contract that involves an exchange of a payment defined in terms of 
a fixed rate on a notional amount (the “fixed leg” of the swap) for a payment defined in 
terms of the realised inflation rate over a predetermined horizon on that same notional 
amount. Only the net cash flows are exchanged at the maturity of the swap, i.e. the 

63  See the article entitled “Inflation expectations in the euro area: a review of recent developments”, Monthly 
Bulletin, ECB, February 2011.

difference between the rate on the fixed leg and the realised inflation rate applied to 
the notional value of the contract. 64 Thus, the ILS rate on the contract is indicative of 
the market’s expected inflation rate over the relevant horizon. The swap contract is 
usually linked to a non-seasonally adjusted consumer price index (CPI). In the euro 
area, the relevant index is the HICP excluding tobacco (HICPxT), while in the United 
States it is the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) and in the 
United Kingdom it is the Retail Price Index (RPI). 

ILS rates provide a cleaner measure of longer-term inflation expectations than 
bond-derived break-even inflation rates (BEIRs). The latter is calculated as the 

spread between nominal and inflation-linked bond yields, often of a particular euro 
area country. Currently, Germany, France, Italy and Spain all have inflation-linked 
bonds which refer to the euro area HICPxT. In contrast to ILS rates, BEIRs can be 
influenced by significant time-varying liquidity effects and country-specific risk 
premia. 65 Therefore, market participants prefer to use market-based measures of 
longer-term inflation expectations derived from ILS rates rather than from BEIRs. 

However, ILS rates still contain risk premia as compensation for inflation risk 

exposure. As with all indicators derived from financial market prices, ILS rates are not 
immune to the influence of risk premia. In particular, ILS rates contain an inflation risk 
premium which compensates investors for the risks surrounding their central 
estimates of inflation over the forecast horizon. The inflation risk premium also has 
informational content – it is not just a correction that needs to be applied in order to 
reveal central expectations, it also tells us which inflation outcomes investors care 
about most. Although the inflation risk premium is unobservable, it can be estimated 
either by modelling the inflation swap curve with an affine term structure model or by 
using a non-model-based proxy, such as the differential between market-based and 
survey-based inflation expectations. Both approaches imply that the lion’s share of the 
movement in ILS rates over the past few years has been due to fluctuations in inflation 
risk premia. 

During the period from 2014 to mid-2016, ILS rates fell significantly across 

major jurisdictions (see Chart 1). A widely used measure of longer-term 
market-based inflation expectations is the “5y5y ILS rate”, i.e. the average inflation 
rate over a five-year period starting in five years’ time, as implied by ILS rates. We 
examine two distinct periods in 5y5y ILS rate developments. First we look at the period 
from 2014 to mid-2016 when 5y5y ILS rates fell considerably across major 
jurisdictions. In the euro area, the 5y5y ILS rate fell by almost 1 percentage point, 

64  For example, if counterparty A wishes to hedge against unexpectedly high inflation over the next year, it 
may enter into a one-year ILS contract with counterparty B for a notional amount of, for illustrative 
purposes, €1 million and pay a fixed leg of 1.90% to counterparty B. If at the end of the contract, realised 
inflation were to stand at 2.50%, counterparty A would receive a net payment of €6,000 = [€1 million * 
(2.50%-1.90%)] from counterparty B (who owes realised inflation to counterparty A). To hedge against 
lower than expected inflation, counterparty A can enter into the other side of this contract (that 
counterparty B undertakes in this example). In any case, the net pay-off to either counterparty is a linear 
function of the level of realised inflation. Note that this example is highly simplified and does not account 
for some technicalities, such as indexation lags, that are present in ILS contracts. 
65  For example, during the euro area sovereign debt crisis there were distortions in the market prices for the 
sovereign debt of some euro area countries. In particular, concerns regarding Italy’s sovereign credit risk 
were reflected in an increase in bond yields, which was more pronounced in inflation-linked bonds, thus 
depressing the implied BEIR. More recently, during periods of financial market risk aversion, safe haven 
flows into nominal German bonds have tended to depress the implied BEIR on German debt.

down from around 2.20% to 1.20%, while in the United States and the United Kingdom 
it went down by 1.10 percentage points (to 1.85%) and 0.70 percentage point (to 
2.90%) respectively. We then look at the period since mid-2016, during which ILS 
rates have recovered somewhat. Indeed, in the euro area, the 5y5y ILS rate stood at 
1.75% in early July 2018, around 50 basis points higher than its trough in 2016.

Notes: The chart shows ILSs that reference the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices excluding tobacco (HICPxT) for the euro area, 
the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) for the United States and the Retail Price Index (RPI) for the United 
Kingdom. The latest observation is for 31 July 2018. 

Consistent w ith these observations, econometric analysis suggests that global 
factors have increasingly influenced the euro area 5y5y ILS rate. Chart 1 shows 

considerable co-movement in the time series of 5y5y ILS rates in the United Kingdom, 
United States and euro area. To ascertain the significance of this relationship and the 
extent to which it has evolved over time, we have conducted a forecast error variance 
decomposition of various ILS rates and other financial variables. 66 We use this vector 
autoregressive (VAR) model to construct two sets of spillover indices: a) overall 
spillovers within the VAR model and b) spillovers to longer-term inflation expectations 
in each jurisdiction. For the latter, the spillover index for the euro area measures how 
much of the two-week-ahead forecast error variance of the 5y5y ILS rate is explained 
by the other variables in the VAR model. 

Spillovers to longer-term inflation expectations rose substantially in 2015, 
possibly reflecting global concerns about weak aggregate demand and 
associated disinflationary pressures (see Chart 2). The error variance 

decomposition implies a high degree of spillovers between the 5y5y ILS rates of all 
three economic areas. In addition, the emergence of a positive wedge between 

66  The decomposition is conducted according to the methodology put forward in Diebold, F.X. and Yilmaz, 
K., “Measuring financial asset return and volatility spillovers, with application to global equity markets”, 
Economic Journal, Royal Economic Society, Vol. 119, No 534, pp. 158-171, January 2009. The analysis 
is based on a VAR model containing a multitude of financial indicators for the euro area, United States 
and United Kingdom. The VAR model is estimated in levels with five lags, using daily data and a two-year 
rolling window. The error variance decomposition is a statistical exercise, which means that causality is 
difficult to ascertain.

spillovers to 5y5y ILS rates and total spillovers (see the green line in Chart 2) suggests 
that spillovers to longer-term inflation expectations were unusually high from 2015 
relative to the other variables in the VAR model. While spillovers from oil prices to 5y5y 
ILS rates also increased over that period, they were not the main driving factor behind 
the overall increase in connectedness between 5y5y ILS rates and other variables in 
the VAR model. Instead, overriding concerns regarding weak global aggregate 
demand and associated disinflationary pressures are more likely to have been the 
cause.

Notes: Each jurisdiction-specific index represents the contribution of shocks from all other variables in the VAR model to the error 
variance in the 5y5y ILS rate in each jurisdiction. Total spillovers can be interpreted as the average contribution of shocks from all other 
variables in the VAR model to the error variance of each variable in the VAR model. Contributions are calculated from the forecast error 
variance matrix inferred from the generalised identification of shocks. The latest observation is for 31 July 2018. 

The inflation risk premium entered into negative territory towards the end of 
2015, as deflation rather than excessive inflation became the key concern and 
investor appetite for inflation-linked instruments fell (see Chart 3). To further 

explore the drivers of the decline in ILS rates, we model the euro area 5y5y inflation 
risk premium using an affine term structure model. 67 The resulting decomposition of 
the 5y5y ILS rate into expectations and the inflation risk premium suggests that most 
of the fall over the period from 2014 to 2016 stemmed from the inflation risk premium 
component. In late 2015 the inflation risk premium even turned negative, indicating 
that adverse economic outcomes were associated with the spectre of deflation and, 
moreover, that investors did not feel the need to protect themselves against 
inflationary scenarios. Indeed, actual inflation outcomes were persistently below the 
survey forecasts of most economists during that period. If investors in inflation-linked 
products also found themselves being continually surprised on the downside, and thus 
paying more for these products than anticipated, this may also have contributed to the 

67  The decomposition is based on an affine term structure model and fitted to the euro area zero-coupon 
ILS curve. The estimation method follows that described in Joslin, S., Singleton, K. and Zhu, H., “A new 
perspective on Gaussian dynamic term structure models”, Review of Financial Studies, Vol. 24, No 3, 
pp. 926-970, 2011. For further details, see Camba-Mendez, G. and Werner, T., “The inflation risk 
premium in the post-Lehman period”, Working Paper Series, No 2033, ECB, March 2017.

lack of appetite for inflation-linked instruments. In turn, this may have led to a 
downward repricing of inflation risks and a corresponding decline in the perceived 
value of inflation protection, i.e. the risk premium. 68

The inflation risk premium fell around the same time as the balance of risks to 
the inflation outlook shifted downwards, as implied by surveys (see Chart 4). 

The forecasts in the ECB SPF are for inflation in five years’ time. Therefore, for ease of 
comparison, we take a shorter horizon estimate of the inflation risk premium, namely 
the one-year ILS rate in four years’ time (1y4y). The inflation risk premium fell in 
tandem with the balance of risks to the inflation outlook, as reflected in the skewness 
measure derived from the survey data. 69 These developments may have been driven 
by concerns about weak aggregate demand and associated disinflationary pressures. 
As Section 3 will discuss, they also coincided with a rise in the probability of deflation, 
as reflected in the prices of inflation options. 

68  In fact, Section 3 shows that the value of deflation protection increased noticeably in late 2014 and early 
2015, before declining more recently.

Notes: The inflation risk premium is based on the decomposition of an affine term structure model and fitted to the euro area zero-coupon 
ILS curve. The estimation method follows Joslin, S., Singleton, K. and Zhu, H. (2011). The skewness measure includes the following 
measures: skewness, quantile skewness, mean-median and mean-point forecast of continuous distributions derived from linear and 
cubic spline interpolation. The individual series comprising the skewness measure have been standardised by their standard deviation 
(since 2001) for ease of comparison. A negative (positive) sign means the balance of risks is perceived as being to the downside 
(upside). The latest observation is for July 2018. 

Since mid-2016 measures of longer-term inflation expectations have trended 

upwards. The euro area 5y5y ILS rate reached a trough in June 2016 (at around 
1.20%), shortly after the United Kingdom’s referendum on European Union 
membership and the turbulent market conditions which ensued. Since then, measures 
of longer-term inflation expectations have trended upwards in the euro area, United 
States and United Kingdom. Looking again at the term structure model decomposition 
of euro area 5y5y ILS rates shown in Chart 3, it is evident that throughout this recovery 
there has been a measurable increase in the inflation risk premium component, albeit 
from historically low and negative levels. This increase is likely to have reflected a 
dissipation of perceived downside risks to the inflation outlook amid a broad-based 
improvement in global economic prospects and an accommodative monetary policy 
stance. The recovery in inflation across all three jurisdictions suggests that common 
factors, such as the global economic cycle, have had a strong influence on 
longer-term inflation expectations. The analysis of spillovers to ILS rates in Chart 2 
indicates that, while spillovers have moderated somewhat, ILS rates remain highly 
connected across jurisdictions. 

Model-based analysis corroborates the notion that the recovery of ILS rates has 
reflected a dissipation of perceived downside risks to the inflation outlook amid 
a broad-based improvement in global and euro area economic prospects (see 

Chart 5). To shed further light on the recent recovery in market-based measures of 
inflation expectations, particularly with a view to understanding the driving forces 
behind it and more formally disentangling their impact, we have employed a 
model-based decomposition. The decomposition is based on a four-jurisdiction 
(United States, United Kingdom, China and the euro area) Bayesian VAR model at 
monthly frequency, which gauges contributions to fluctuations in variables using a 
historical shock decomposition. Besides the euro area 5y5y ILS rate, the set of

variables includes real and financial variables, uncertainty indicators and commodity 
prices. It has been selected on the basis of economic rationale and relevance, as 
suggested by existing studies and market reports. The decomposition of the 
cumulative increase in the euro area 5y5y ILS rate since June 2016 (when the 5y5y 
ILS rate hit a trough) suggests that it was due primarily to a combination of euro area 
and international factors. This would be consistent with the dissipation of perceived 
downside risks to the inflation outlook amid a broad-based improvement in global 
economic prospects. Since then the euro area 5y5y ILS rate has gained further 
momentum owing to improvements in the euro area growth outlook. Commodity prices 
have played a limited role over the entire time horizon, but over the course of 2018 
they have had a positive impact on the euro area 5y5y ILS rate.

The distribution of market-based inflation expectations 

Analysing the prices of euro area inflation options provides timely insights into 
the distribution of market participants’ inflation expectations over and above 
the central tendency reflected in swap rates. Inflation options differ from ILSs in 

that they are instruments with “non-linear” pay-offs. In the case of euro area inflation 
options, this means that either (i) they pay out if inflation as measured by the euro area 
HICPxT exceeds a certain threshold, and zero otherwise (inflation caps) or (ii) they 
pay out if inflation falls short of a certain threshold, and zero otherwise (inflation floors). 
Inflation options thus effectively offer insurance against a certain inflation event and, 
all else equal, investors’ willingness to pay for such insurance will depend on the

expectations

probability of the given event. By comparing the prices of options that insure against 
different outcomes, it is possible to infer the probability that investors assign to those 
different outcomes – in other words, the probability distribution of market participants’ 
inflation expectations. 

Developments in option-implied probabilities for a range of inflation events 
show that the distribution of inflation expectations has changed considerably 

in recent years (see Chart 6). The chart tracks the so-called risk-neutral probability 
of various relevant inflation outcomes, as implied by “zero-coupon” options whose 
pay-offs depend on average euro area inflation over a five-year period (see Box 1 for a 
discussion of the appropriate interpretation of risk-neutral probabilities). 70 As such, 
the probabilities essentially reflect spot inflation expectations over the next five years 
starting today and hence cannot be compared one for one with, for example, the 
aforementioned 5y5y ILS rate, which is a five-year forward rate starting in five years. 
The evolution of the implied distribution is nonetheless useful as five years is a 
sufficiently long period to cover not only market participants’ expectations regarding 
near-term developments of euro area inflation, but crucially also the medium-term 
inflation outlook.

In particular, the option-implied distributions shifted towards concerns about 
deflation in late 2014 and early 2015, which then steadily receded follow ing the 

introduction of the APP. Chart 6 shows that the risk-neutral probability of deflation 
had started to increase noticeably towards the end of 2014, before peaking 
significantly above previously recorded levels in January 2015 when the APP was

State-Contingent Claims Implicit in Option Prices”, Journal of Business, Vol. 51, No 4, pp. 621-651, 1978. 
Option prices are translated into implied volatilities using the Black-Scholes formula, and implied 
volatilities are interpolated following Shimko, D., “Bounds of Probability”, RISK, No 6, pp. 33-37, 1993.

announced. At that point in time, the balance of probabilities around investors’ inflation 
outlook for the euro area was heavily tilted towards deflationary and low, but positive, 
outcomes (i.e., between 0% and 1.5%) – a clear shift from three years earlier when the 
option-implied distribution revealed market participants were assigning a far greater 
probability to high inflation outcomes (i.e., above 2.5%). Following the announcement 
of the APP, the risk of deflation as implied by euro area inflation option prices declined 
markedly, albeit remaining somewhat elevated for some time thereafter. However, as 
the APP continued and the general inflation outlook improved, the spectre of deflation 
in the euro area gradually vanished and is now seen as negligible by market 
participants. 

The information contained in the prices of euro area inflation options also 
suggests that investors have started to price in gradually decreasing levels of 

inflation uncertainty. This trend is not only evident from Chart 6, which illustrates that 
the aforementioned steady decline in the option-implied risk of deflation has not been 
accompanied by a concomitant increase in the likelihood of high inflation outcomes, 
and that the option-implied probability currently assigned to high inflation and deflation 
outcomes combined is noticeably below the level prevailing towards the beginning of 
the period under review. It is also evident from Chart 7, which shows the evolution of 
inflation uncertainty as measured by the option-implied volatility – a gauge of the 
spread of the distribution (see the blue line) – next to developments in the five-year 
swap rate – a gauge of the central tendency of the distribution (see the yellow line). 71 
Clearly, the downward trend in option-implied volatilities throughout the period from 
2012 to 2014 that went hand in hand with declines in the swap rate was subsequently 
not reversed. In fact, despite the noticeable recovery in the swap rate since the second 
half of 2016, implied volatilities have remained at very low levels and, if anything, 
declined even further. This suggests that investors’ uncertainty regarding euro area 
inflation and the risk premia they are demanding continue to be relatively low, also 
given the substantial improvement in the inflation outlook (see also Chart 3). 

71  Implied volatility is an important concept in option pricing. It denotes the level of volatility in the option’s 
underlying asset over the life of the option contract that, given an option pricing model, is consistent with 
the current market price of the option. Intuitively, higher prices for options that insure against a certain 
event are associated with higher probabilities of that event occurring in the future. In turn, all else equal, 
higher probabilities require higher levels of future volatility in the underlying. Implied volatilities can 
therefore be extracted from prices based on a given option pricing model. For example, if investors 
become more uncertain about the inflation outlook, i.e. they assume a higher volatility going forward, the 
prices of inflation options will increase. It is important to note the forward-looking and subjective nature of 
implied volatility, which sets it apart from the concept of historical, or realised, volatility.

Box 1 

Interpreting option-implied probabilities 

Prepared by Benjamin Böninghausen, Gregory Kidd and Rupert de Vincent-Humphreys 

It is important to stress that option-implied “risk-neutral” probabilities, while containing 
valuable information, must not be interpreted as being identical to the underlying “physical” 

probabilities of inflation events. Practically speaking, this means that an option-implied probability 
of, for example, 25% for deflation does not imply that investors believe there is a one-in-four chance 
that deflation will actually emerge. This is somewhat counterintuitive, but as this box explains, it is due 
to the presence of risk premia in financial markets. 

Option-implied “risk-neutral” probabilities are obtained under standard no-arbitrage 
considerations w ithout making assumptions about investors’ risk preferences. The 

option-implied distributions of euro area inflation expectations presented in this article build on, 
among other things, the well-known Black-Scholes option pricing model. That model postulates that 
investors cannot earn a risk-free profit by buying (or selling) an option and simultaneously selling (or 
probability measure, typically denoted by 𝑄𝑄 . More formally, and to put it simply, the price of an 
of “no arbitrage” is central to asset pricing theory and gives rise to probabilities under a risk-neutral 
buying) a portfolio of other assets that exactly replicates the future pay-off from the option. This notion 
inflation-linked asset today (𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖 ) depends on the risk-neutral probabilities 𝑃𝑃𝑄𝑄 (𝜋𝜋) and expected 
one-period-ahead pay-offs 𝐸𝐸𝑖𝑖 �𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖+1 (𝜋𝜋)� associated with different inflation events 𝜋𝜋 ∈ Π, as well as 
the risk-free rate 𝑟𝑟𝑓𝑓 : 
(1) 
future pay-offs discounted at the risk-free rate. Letting 𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖 equal the current market price, it is possible 
The price of the asset under the no-arbitrage condition is thus a probability-weighted sum of expected

However, as real-world investors tend to be risk-averse, the extracted risk-neutral 
probabilities reflect risk preferences as much as they reflect the underlying physical 

As a result, risk-neutral probabilities tend to overstate the corresponding physical 
probabilities for tail events and vice versa for non-tail events. To see this, note that extracting

the known risk-free rate 𝑟𝑟𝑓𝑓 . 
probabilities of different outcomes. Risk-averse investors are willing to pay a premium to insure 
against the disutility associated with particularly adverse outcomes. For instance, in the context of 
inflation, this can mean that investors value more highly the pay-offs from options that pay out in the 
values that investors assign to future pay-offs in different states of the world 𝜋𝜋 ∈ Π, with those states 
case of tail events such as deflation or (very) high inflation than those that pay out in the case of low, 
but positive, inflation. The actual price of inflation options therefore reflects the discounted sum of the 
weighted by the actual, or physical, probabilities P(𝜋𝜋) under the 𝑃𝑃 measure. 
𝑃𝑃𝑄𝑄 (𝜋𝜋) based on equation (1) is conditional on the expected future pay-offs 𝐸𝐸𝑖𝑖 �𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖+1(𝜋𝜋)� across 
inflation events 𝜋𝜋 ∈ Π, rather than on how much value investors actually assign to them. Hence, 
𝐸𝐸𝑖𝑖 �𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖+1(𝜋𝜋)� will generally represent a relative underestimation of these values in the case of tail 
𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖 , this needs to be compensated by extracted risk-neutral probabilities 𝑃𝑃𝑄𝑄 (𝜋𝜋) that are higher than 
events and a relative overestimation in the case of non-tail events. Clearly, for a given market price 
the true, physical probabilities P(𝜋𝜋) in the case of tail events, but lower in the case of non-tail events. 
Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF). The SPF lends itself to this purpose as it asks survey 
participants not only for their expectations regarding euro area inflation over different time horizons, 
but also for the probabilities they assign to different outcomes across the entire inflation spectrum for 
those same horizons. These probabilities can be interpreted as true, physical probabilities that are 
unaffected by risk premia and therefore provide a natural reference point for assessing the degree to 
which market participants price risk premia into inflation options. 

The impact of risk premia on the level of option-implied risk-neutral probabilities for euro area 
inflation can also be illustrated by comparing them w ith the results reported in the ECB

Notes: “Option-implied” refers to the risk-neutral probability of a given inflation outcome, as extracted from the prices of one-year zero-coupon options based on 
the (three-month lagged) euro area Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices excluding tobacco (HICPxT) inflation. “ECB SPF” refers to the physical probability for 
euro area HICP inflation over the next year, as implied by the responses of professional forecasters surveyed by the ECB (based on the results for the first 
quarter of 2018). For ease of comparison, risk-neutral probabilities are evaluated at the date of the deadline for SPF participants to respond (11 January 2018). 
The “Ratio of risk-neutral probabilities to physical probabilities” is calculated by dividing the option-implied probabilities by the SPF-implied probabilities. 

Chart A shows that the option-implied probabilities indeed tend to be larger than the 
survey-implied physical probabilities in the tails of the distribution, which is consistent w ith 
the notion that investors require risk premia for the associated inflation events. The chart 

compares the results for one-year-ahead euro area inflation, which is the horizon that allows for the 
closest matching given the availability of euro area inflation options and the horizons considered in 
the SPF. The option-implied probabilities (see the blue bars) clearly exceed the survey-implied 
probabilities (see the yellow bars) for those scenarios in which inflation is either negative or above 
3%. In each case, risk-neutral probabilities are roughly three times higher than the physical 
probabilities (see the red markers). By contrast, physical probabilities tend to be higher than their 
risk-neutral counterparts for the low, but positive, inflation outcomes in between the aforementioned 
tail events. These observations are consistent with risk-averse investors valuing the pay-off from 
inflation options more highly in deflation and high inflation regimes, resulting in a larger wedge 
between the associated risk-neutral and physical probabilities. 72 

Although option-implied probabilities need to be interpreted bearing in mind the above 
considerations, tracking their evolution over time does convey important information on 
changes in investors’ assessment of the euro area inflation outlook. The reason is that changes 

in risk-neutral probabilities and their physical counterparts will broadly be in line with each other, 
unless there is a negative correlation between the true, physical probabilities and risk premia. 
However, this latter scenario would mean that, in the case of deflation for example, an investor would 
need to systematically revise downwards the risk premium for deflation whenever the odds of this 
event materialising are seen as increasing. This seems quite implausible – in fact, physical 
probabilities and risk premia would generally be expected to move together over time (to varying 
degrees). Tracking the evolution of option-implied probabilities therefore provides useful and timely 
signals regarding shifts in investors’ underlying inflation outlook.

Conclusions 

Market-based indicators of euro area inflation expectations have recently 
recovered on the back of a significant improvement in the domestic 
macroeconomic outlook, follow ing a marked decline between 2014 and 

mid-2016. The review of developments in longer-term market-based indicators of 
inflation expectations in this article suggests that this decline correlated with similar 
trends in other major jurisdictions. Further analysis indicates that, in addition to 
domestic factors, global concerns about sluggish aggregate demand and related 
disinflationary pressures played their part in the fall in market-based measures of euro 
area inflation expectations. The subsequent recovery appears to have been driven by 
a partial dissipation of these concerns and, in particular, a substantial improvement in 

72  It is important to note that probabilities reported in surveys rely on subjective distributions. However, there 
is ev idence that experts tend to be overly confident in the accuracy of their assessment of the future – in 
other words, they may assign too small a probability to tail events. Some of the wedge between the 
survey-implied probabilities for tail events and their option-implied risk-neutral counterparts may 
therefore also be attributable to this “overconfidence effect”.

the macroeconomic picture for the euro area, notably also as a reflection of the ECB’s 
accommodative monetary policy. 

The recent developments in longer-term market-based indicators have been 
due primarily to the inflation risk premium, which changed in line w ith the shifts 
in the balance of risks to the inflation outlook. A decomposition of the movements 

in market-based indicators shows that both the pure expectations component and the 
inflation risk premium component contributed to the initial decline and subsequent 
recovery. However, most of the fall between 2014 and mid-2016 is estimated to have 
stemmed from the risk premium component, which fell around the same time as the 
downward shift in the balance of risks implied by the skewness of the probability 
distributions reported in the SPF. Taken together, these two factors indicate that 
investors felt little need to hedge against inflationary scenarios at the trough of 
mid-2016, but were instead concerned about deflationary outcomes. 

Market-based indicators also suggest that the spectre of deflation in the euro 
area has steadily receded follow ing the ECB’s launch of the APP and is now 

regarded as negligible by investors. This article has used the prices of inflation 
options that insure against different inflation outcomes to extract market-implied 
probability distributions for the euro area inflation outlook. The implied probability of 
deflation peaked markedly above previously recorded levels in January 2015, when 
the ECB announced its APP. At that time, the balance of probabilities around investors’ 
inflation outlook was tilted heavily towards deflationary and low, but positive, inflation 
outcomes. However, as the APP continued and the general economic and inflation 
outlook in the euro area improved, the spectre of deflation in the euro area gradually 
vanished.

Developments in the circulation of euro banknotes 

1.1 

Overall developments in circulation 

The value of euro banknotes in circulation grew continuously during the period 
from January 2008 to December 2017, w ith an average annual growth rate of 

6.1%. At the end of 2017, the total value of euro banknotes in circulation was 
€1,171 billion, with an annual growth rate of 4.0%. Seasonal patterns in circulation can 
be observed especially during summer holidays and the Christmas period (see 
Chart 1). The ratio of banknotes in circulation to nominal gross domestic product 
(GDP) has increased from 7.9% to 10.5% over the past ten years, indicating that, 
while in line with the GDP growth trend (see Chart 2), the value of euro banknotes in 
circulation has been growing faster than the overall economy and that other factors 
have therefore been contributing to this increase. Some of these factors are described 
in more detail in the present article.

During the period under review, the euro was successively adopted by Cyprus 
and Malta (2008), Slovakia (2009), Estonia (2011), Latvia (2014) and Lithuania 

(2015). The effects of the euro’s introduction in these countries on the total number 
and value of euro banknotes in circulation has, however, been very limited. Two 
months after their respective introductions of the euro, these countries’ contributions to 
the total value of euro banknotes in circulation ranged between 0.03% and 0.35%. 

Apart from the introduction of the euro in the aforementioned six Member States, euro 
banknote circulation over the period from 2008 until the end of 2017 was characterised 
by four main events. 

The Lehman Brothers crisis – Between January and September 2008 the average 
annual growth rate of the value in circulation was 7.6%. Following the bankruptcy of 
Lehman Brothers on 15 September 2008 the net issuance of euro banknotes 
increased by €43.7 billion in October, of which net shipments of euro banknotes to 
regions outside the euro area amounted to €13.7 billion, the highest value since the 
introduction of the euro. From October 2008 until the end of September 2009, the 
value of banknotes in circulation continued to rise, with an average annual growth rate 
of 13.0%. Over this period the value in circulation increased by €83.3 billion, as 
compared to only €46.6 billion for the period from October 2007 to the end of 
September 2008. From this it can be inferred that the additional growth of the value in 
circulation due to the crisis amounted to around €37 billion. The €50, €100 and 
€500 denominations, which accounted for 18.4%, 17.5% and 56.9% of the additional 
increase, respectively, provided the greatest contribution. 

The sovereign debt crisis – Autumn 2009 marked the beginning of the European 
sovereign debt crisis, whose effects on banknote demand lasted until the end of 2013. 
In an environment of uncertainty on the financial markets, lack of trust in government 
debt and low GDP growth in the euro area, demand for euro banknotes decelerated 
and the annual growth rate of the value in circulation reached its all-time low of 1.5%. 

ECB Economic Bulletin, Issue 6 / 2018 – Articles 
Trends and developments in the use of euro cash over the past ten years 

88 

 
 
Nevertheless, for the entire period from October 2009 to the end of 2013, the annual 
increase in the value in circulation was still relatively strong, averaging 4.6%. 

The economic recovery in the euro area – Together with low interest rates (see 

Box 3), this resulted in an acceleration in banknote circulation growth from the 
beginning of 2014. In December 2014, the depreciation of the Russian rouble against 
the euro led to a remarkable increase in purchases of euro banknotes from regions 
outside the euro area, primarily Russia. Net shipments in December 2014 amounted 
to €6.5 billion, marking the highest monthly volume observed since the 2008-2009 
financial crisis. The average annual growth rate during the period from January 2014 
to January 2016 was 6.8%. 

The Governing Council decision on the €500 – On 4 May 2016 the Governing 

Council decided to discontinue production of the €500 banknote with immediate effect 
and to stop its issuance around the end of 2018. The circulation of €500 banknotes 
has continuously declined since the first discussions on the topic were reported in the 
media in February 2016, although this decline has levelled off since April 2017. At the 
end of 2017 the value of €500 banknotes in circulation amounted to €256.8 billion, 
compared to €306.8 billion at the end of 2015. At the same time, the demand for €200, 
€100 and €50 denominations increased more than in previous years. This increase to 
a large extent offset the decline in €500 circulation. On average, from February 2016 
to December 2017 annual circulation growth was 4.4%. 

1.2 

Denominational structure of the banknote 

The €50 is by far the most circulated banknote. The €500 was the denomination 

with the highest share of banknotes in circulation in terms of value until April 2012, 
after which point the €50 became the most important denomination. At the end of 
2017, the €50 accounted for 42% of the total value in circulation (see Charts 3 and 4). 
The popularity of the €50 can be attributed to the fact that this denomination is used 
both for transaction purposes and as a store of value. As a consequence of the 
Governing Council decision to stop issuing the €500, the increase in the total value of 
€50 and €100 banknotes in circulation accelerated further from February 2016. In 
October 2017, the €100 overtook the €500 as the second most important 
denomination in circulation in terms of value. The total value of €200 banknotes in 
circulation showed only slightly higher growth after the €500 decision. The combined 
share of the three highest euro denominations at the end of 2017 amounted to 48.5%. 
In comparison, the $100 banknote had a share of 79.7% of the total value of US dollar 
banknotes in circulation at that time. By contrast, since January 2008 the three lowest 
denominations (€5, €10 and €20), which are mainly used for transaction purposes, 
have had relatively steady shares of the value in circulation, totalling 10.5% at the end 
of 2008 and 9.5% at the end of 2017.

Looking at the contribution of each denomination to the share of the banknote 
value in circulation as a percentage of GDP (see Chart 5), it is clear that the €50 
and €100 banknotes in particular contributed to the increase in the cash to GDP 

ratio. The ratio of €500 banknotes to GDP increased to 3% during the first year after 
the Lehman Brother crisis, after which it began to decline. This trend accelerated with 
the announcement of the decision to stop issuing the €500 banknote, with the ratio 
reaching 2.3% at the end of 2017. By contrast, the ratio of €200 banknotes to GDP has 
seen only a very marginal increase over the past ten years and the ratios of €5 and 
€10 banknotes to GDP have remained stable, confirming that these banknotes are 
typically used for transaction purposes. Surprisingly, the ratio of €20 banknotes to

The different drivers of euro banknote circulation 

2.1 

The use of cash for domestic transactions 

Euro banknotes are used as payment instruments by 340 million European 
citizens for their daily private or professional transactions. The determinants of 

cash held and used for private transactions at points-of-sale (POS) were described in 
detail in a recent ECB study. 73 Cash is also held by merchants and in vending, 
ticketing and gaming machines as well as stored by monetary financial institutions 
(MFIs) for distribution via bank counters or ATMs (see Box 3). 

Box 1 

The use of cash at POS, insights from a survey 

Prepared by Elisabetta Maria Saini and Henk Esselink 

Additional insights from the survey on the use of cash by households in the euro area 
The ECB Occasional Paper “The use of cash by households in the euro area” revealed that, across 
the euro area in 2016, an average of 79% of all POS transactions were carried out using cash. In 
terms of the value of transactions, cash accounted for a share of 54%. 74 The average value of a 
transaction made using any means of payment was €18.10. The average value of a cash transaction 
was €12.38. Indeed, as already shown in the study, approximately two-thirds of all payments were for 
less than €15, of which 88% were made in cash. In other words, cash is generally used for 
small-value transactions. At the same time, only 8% of all POS transactions involved amounts of €50 
or more and only 2% of the number of all POS transactions involved amounts of €100 or more. When 
looking at the value of transactions, however, the picture is different. In value terms, in 2016 only 20% 
of all POS transactions involved amounts less than €15, and those involving amounts of €50 or more 
represented 43% of the total value of POS transactions, as shown in Chart A. 

73  See Esselink, H. and Hernandez, L., “The use of cash by households in the euro area”, Occasional Paper 
Series, No 201, ECB, Frankfurt am Main, November 2017. 
74  The study was based on a payment diary survey in 17 euro area countries. The results of separate 
surveys in Germany and the Netherlands, carried out in 2014 and 2016, respectively, were integrated to 
show the share of cash in POS transactions across the entire euro area. In February 2018 the Deutsche 
Bundesbank published the results of a payment diary study entitled “Payment behav iour in Germany in 
2017 – Fourth study of the utilisation of cash and cashless payment instruments”. The results showed a 
decrease in the share of cash payments in Germany by 5 percentage points in number and 6 percentage 
points in value compared with the 2014 survey, suggesting that the euro area results on cash use would 
have been slightly lower if German results for 2016 had been available for the euro area study.

Note: This survey was conducted in 2016. 

Higher-value transactions are mainly carried out using payment cards, but more than 
one-third of POS transactions involving amounts greater than €100 are still made in cash. 

Nevertheless, in line with the other findings of the study, there are large differences across the euro 
area in the use of cash for payments, including for amounts greater than €100. Chart B shows that in 
seven euro area countries more than 50% of POS payments, in terms of value, were in cash, while in 
other countries such as France and Belgium the share of high-value transactions using cash was 
relatively minor.

they w ill pay w ith cash. However, not all consumers behave similarly in terms of the thresholds at 
which they pay with cash, cards or other means: only 49% of the respondents in the 17 euro area

countries in which the question was asked responded that their choice of payment instrument 
depended on the amount to be paid, with roughly one-third of respondents stating that they typically 
paid amounts less than €20 using cash (see Chart C). In contrast, 50% of respondents said that their 
payment behaviour is not normally dependent on the amount to be paid, 23% reported that they 
always paid with cash, and 27% normally always paid with cards. The results by country are in line 
with expectations based on other results of the survey. More than 50% of the respondents in Estonia 
and in Finland stated that they typically used cards, irrespective of the amount, while in Cyprus, Malta, 
Greece, Italy and Austria, less than 20% of respondents typically did so.

The future of cash used for transaction purposes 
The results of recent payment behaviour surveys are presented in Chart D. Consumer payment 
behaviour in the countries in question is heterogeneous, with Germany and Switzerland being 
primarily cash-based countries and Sweden almost a cashless society. Cash usage in the euro area 
as a whole is comparable to that in Germany. Interestingly, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands 
have followed almost the exact same pattern of declining cash usage. All of the countries that have 
conducted surveys over time have found that the use of cash as a percentage of total transactions 
has fallen, albeit at different rates, and while its speed cannot be predicted, a similar decline in the use 
of cash can be expected for the euro area as a whole as well.

Notes: The surveys are based on different scopes (e.g. focus on POS transactions or all transactions) and methodologies. The data for Sweden are taken from 
the Swedish survey question: How did you pay the last time you paid for something? 

The introduction of the second series of euro banknotes (i.e. the Europa series) 
provides a unique opportunity to estimate the percentage of banknotes in 
circulation used for domestic transaction purposes. The €5 to €50 denominations 

of the Europa series have been introduced successively since 2013. 75 The pace of the 
replacement of first series banknotes in circulation by second series banknotes within 
a defined period of time may provide an indication of the percentage of banknotes in 
circulation used for payment transactions. 76 First series banknotes returning from 
circulation after this defined period may indicate that they were used as a store of 
value or held abroad. However, estimates based on this method have several 
limitations. First, both series were issued in different ways across denominations and 
countries. For example, each country had a different period during which first series 
banknotes of a certain denomination were still issued by the central bank following the 
introduction of the new series. Second, although the ECB has stated that the first 
series banknotes will retain their status as legal tender, the announcement of the 
launch of the second series may have, to a certain extent, triggered the use of first 
series banknotes which would otherwise have been kept as a store of value. Third, the 
minimum period after which a returned banknote can be considered to have been 
used as a store of value cannot be accurately determined. 

Charts 6(a) to (d) show that after 12 months the percentages of second series 
banknotes out of the total in circulation were 57% for the €5 and the €20, 67% 

for the €10 and 31% for the €50. Assuming that these saturation rates represent the 
active part of the €5 to €50 banknotes in circulation, it can be estimated that the value

25 November 2015 and €50 on 4 April 2017.

March 2018, pp. 44-49, and Bartzsch, N., “Transaction balances of small denomination banknotes:

in circulation of €5 to €50 banknotes being used for transaction purposes is around 
€220 billion, i.e. slightly less than 20% of that of all denominations at the end of 2017. 
However, considering that the saturation had not fully stabilised after 12 months, the 
active circulation of these denominations is probably somewhat higher. Furthermore, 
the total share of cash in circulation used for transactions would be higher if the 
transaction values of the €100, €200 and €500 denominations were also taken into 
account. 

As also shown in Charts 6(a) to (d), two years after the introduction of the 
Europa series, 27% of €5 and €20 and 21% of €10 banknotes of the first series 

have still not returned from circulation. The total value of all non-returned €5 to 
€20 banknotes as at the end of 2017 amounted to €24 billion. Some of these 
non-returned banknotes may have been lost, taken abroad or stored somewhere and 
forgotten. In any case all first series euro banknotes can continue to be used. 77

77  The ECB may decide to withdraw their legal tender status at some point, following a timely 
announcement. However, all euro banknotes will always retain their value because it will always be 
possible to exchange them at the national central banks of the Eurosystem.

The use of euro banknotes outside the euro area 

International demand for the euro is strong, although it has levelled off since 

the middle of 2015. Euro banknotes are also held outside the euro area for 
transaction purposes (e.g. euroisation 79, cross-border shopping, travel for leisure or 
business) and as a store of value (e.g. savings, currency reserves and asset portfolio 
management). Non-euro area demand is partially captured in the net shipments data, 
which cover registered flows of euro banknotes between central banks and MFIs in the 
euro area, on the one hand, and any legal persons outside the euro area, on the other. 
As at the end of 2017 the total cumulated net shipments (i.e. exports minus imports) of 
euro banknotes to regions outside the euro area amounted to €162.5 billion, which 
represented 13.9% of the total value in circulation (see Chart 7). 

Monthly net shipments of euro banknotes have shown significant volatility 

during the period under review. The highest peaks in demand for euro banknotes 
occurred in October 2008, following the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, and when the 
EUR/RUB exchange rate jumped from 57.5 at the end of November 2014 to 70.3 by 
the end of the next month. Cumulated net shipments began to fall in August 2015.

Notes: The latest observations are for 31 December 2017. 

The fall in net shipments as of August 2015 can be attributed to a combination 

of factors. The perception of declining geopolitical uncertainty and increasing stability 
in regions bordering the euro area (e.g. Russia) as well as the Governing Council 
decision on the €500 may have driven down exports of €500 banknotes, while efforts 
by local authorities to promote the use of domestic currencies in euroised countries 
(i.e. the Western Balkans) may have led to increased imports of euro banknotes. 80 
This is supported by the figures in Charts 8 and 9. The decline in net shipments can be 
attributed both to the fall in euro banknote exports (especially of the €500) and to the 

79  Montenegro and Kosovo use the euro as a currency without a formal arrangement.

increase in imports (mainly of the €50). 81 More information on the circulation of euro 
banknotes outside the euro area can be found in the section on sales and purchases 
of euro banknotes by region (Box 2). 

The €100 banknote is the preferred denomination on the international market. In 

more general terms, since February 2016 the €100 banknote has been the preferred 
denomination on the international market, overtaking the €500. The €50 is the most 
imported banknote, with total cumulated imports greater than total cumulated exports. 
This can be seen as a sign that more €50 banknotes leave the euro area unregistered 
and return via official channels than the other way around. This could, for example, 
occur when remitters take cash back to their home country or to countries in which 
their families live, when euro area tourists use euro banknotes in neighbouring 
countries where it is accepted (e.g. Turkey or Bulgaria) and, probably to a much lesser 
extent, when non-euro area tourists or business travellers leave the euro area and 
take euro banknotes with them. Low-denomination and €200 banknotes play a minor 
role in overseas demand. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that a large percentage of 
exported €200 banknotes is not reimported (between January 2013 and the end of 
2017 the value of exported and imported €200 banknotes reached €20.9 billion and 
€4.6 billion, respectively).

A large percentage of the total number of euro banknotes in circulation may be 

held abroad. It is very difficult to estimate the amount of cash held outside the euro 
area. A method published on the ECB website 82 proposes calculating the minimum 
and maximum value of banknotes circulating outside the euro area on the basis of net 
shipments data (with a correction for the negative net shipments of €50), on the one 
hand, and a coins to banknotes ratio, taking into account the relative changes in the 
value of coins and banknotes in circulation, on the other hand. This method relies on 
the assumption that coin circulation abroad is negligible and that the increase in the 
value of coins in circulation is entirely the result of transaction needs within the euro 
area. The final estimate is given by the average of the two boundaries. Based on this 
method, it is estimated that around 30% of the total value in circulation (approximately 
€350 billion) was held outside the euro area at the end of 2017. 

Box 2 

Sales and purchases of euro banknotes to/from regions outside the euro area 

Prepared by Olivier Strube 

Banknote wholesalers act as intermediaries between national central banks (NCBs) and 
commercial banks, bureaux de change and central banks in regions outside the euro area. 

They are responsible for most of the transactions included in the monthly net shipments statistics. 
The ECB has been collecting euro banknote trade data from these international banknote 
wholesalers, of which around ten operate globally or at least in certain regions of the world, on an 
annual basis. In terms of value, from 2008 to 2017 sales by wholesalers (euro banknote exports) 
decreased by around 30% while their purchases (euro banknote imports) increased by around 40%. 
In 2017 overall sales amounted to €52 billion and overall purchases to €55 billion. Charts A and B 
show sales and purchases by region from 2008 to 2017. Chart A illustrates the volatility of the Russian 
market, which represents a large share of eastern European (non-EU) sales.

Charts C and D indicate that, in 2017, around two-thirds of the value of all euro banknote 
shipments of wholesale banks related to purchase and sale transactions w ith European 

countries, including Russia and Turkey. On the sales side (see Chart C) exports to Switzerland, 
which is included in western Europe (non-EU), dominated, accounting for 28% of all euro banknote 
sales in 2017. Euro banknotes are dispensed by many ATMs in Switzerland and used for shopping in 
the surrounding euro area countries. 20% of all sales went to eastern Europe (non-EU), mostly to 
Russia, where euro banknotes serve predominantly as a store of value. The EU, in this case primarily 
the United Kingdom, accounted for 15% of all sales. That demand can be linked to tourism, in the 
form of British residents withdrawing euro banknotes before going abroad. On the purchase side (see 
Chart D), eastern non-EU countries, especially Turkey, predominated in 2017 and accounted for 30%

of all banknote purchases. These euro banknotes were either carried to Turkey by Turkish workers in 
the euro area (remittances) or by tourists. Similarly, the high share of purchases from EU countries 
(28%) can be explained by remittances.

Asia & Australia, the Middle East and Africa, in this case primarily sub-Saharan Africa, were 
responsible for roughly equal shares of the sales to regions outside the euro area. On the purchase 
side, China and the United Arab Emirates dominated thanks to their roles as international 
marketplaces where goods are traded using international currencies. The significant purchases from 
Africa, in this case primarily northern Africa, can be explained by remittances and tourism. Euro 
banknote transactions with the Americas have traditionally been negligible due to the prevailing role 
of the US dollar in those regions.

The use of cash as a domestic store of value 

In line w ith the Keynesian approach to the demand for money, speculation and 
precautionary motives are the two other motives for holding cash. As seen in 

previous sections, financial or currency crises affecting currencies in regions 
neighbouring the euro area have the potential to increase demand for euro banknotes 
as a precautionary measure. At the same time, a lack of trust in the euro can have a 
negative impact on demand for euro banknotes. In terms of speculation, the main 
determinant of cash demand relates to the opportunity costs of holding cash. The low 
interest rates of the past ten years mean that the opportunity costs of holding cash 
have been reduced for consumers and firms. Meanwhile, some banks have used cash 
to avoid the negative interest rates on the ECB’s deposit facility or on their current 
accounts with central banks (see Box 3). 

Box 3 

The cash holdings of monetary financial institutions in the euro area 

Prepared by Laure Lalouette 

The interest rate on the ECB deposit facility was lowered to 0% on 11 July 2012. It was then 

lowered by a further 0.10 percentage point on 11 June 2014, on 10 September 2014 and again on 
9 December 2015. These decisions did not have a noticeable impact on the amount of cash held by 
MFIs (i.e. in their vaults and in cash dispensers, referred to as vault cash) until 16 March 2016, when 
the Governing Council decided to lower the interest rate on the ECB deposit facility to -0.40%. This 
decision represented a pivotal point for some MFIs, after which they decided to convert part of their 
liquidity into cash, as illustrated in Chart A. For these MFIs, the costs of cash (i.e. costs associated 
with cash storage and handling) were obviously less than the losses resulting from the negative yields 
from the ECB deposit facility and current accounts held at NCBs. An average of €50.1 billion was held 
as vault cash by MFIs between January 2008 and March 2016. Between March 2016 and 
December 2017 the amount of vault cash held by MFIs increased by €21.1 billion and reached 
€76.8 billion, i.e. 6.6% of the total value in circulation. The increase in vault cash was mostly driven by 
German MFIs (69.4% of the increase) and, to a lesser extent, by Italian, French, Austrian and 
Spanish MFIs.

This increase in vault cash has, however, remained limited. Logistical constraints such as storage 
capacities or maximum amounts covered by insurance are the most likely limitations on MFIs holding 
larger amounts of cash. 

There are several methods to estimate the share of cash used as a store of 
value, including direct methods (by means of surveys) and indirect methods. 

Surveys tend to underestimate the use of cash as a store of value, as respondents are 
often not comfortable disclosing to research companies that they store cash at home 
or in another safe place. Moreover, respondents may not be willing to disclose the real 
amount of their savings, especially if such amounts are substantial. The questions in 
the “The use of cash by households in the euro area” study which focused on cash 
held at home by the respondents as precautionary reserves provide some insights into 
hoarding behaviour across the euro area in 2016. Results show that almost 25% of 
respondents have at least some cash outside a bank account, either at home or in a 
safe place. Of those, 78% stated that they keep less than €1,000 in total, 12% that 
they keep more than €1,000 and 10% refused to answer (see Chart 10). Those 
respondents hoarding more than €1,000 in total may have a noticeable impact on the 
average amount used as a store of value, but as there is no indication of the exact 
value no estimate can be made on the basis of these results. Nevertheless, the results 
show that people do store cash, and that some even store considerable amounts.

Notes: German results excluded given lack of available data. This survey was conducted in 2016. 

A simple indirect method to estimate the share of cash used as a store of value is to 
assume that domestic hoarding is the residual of the circulation being used for 
transaction purposes, held by MFIs or held abroad. In this case, it can be inferred from 
the previous sections that more than one-third of total euro banknote circulation may 
currently be in use as a store of value within the euro area. Considering the numerous 
assumptions made, however, these estimates should be viewed with a significant 
degree of caution. 

Box 4 

Growth in euro coin circulation over the last ten years 

Prepared by Laure Lalouette and Elisabetta Maria Saini 

Unlike the issuance of euro banknotes, the issuance of euro coins is a national competence. 

NCBs are responsible for the physical distribution of euro coins in nearly all euro area countries, 
although the ECB is responsible for approving the annual volume of coins that euro countries may 
issue. 

In a manner similar to banknote circulation, the value of euro coin circulation grew continuously during 
the period from 2008 to 2017, at an average annual rate of 4.0%. Overall, the total value of euro coins 
in circulation at the end of 2017 was €28 billion (see Chart A). In addition to coins intended for 
circulation, each country may also issue collector coins. The total value in circulation of the latter at 
the end of 2017 was €4 billion. Of the eight coin denominations, the €2 has the highest share of the 
value in circulation followed by the €1, with 43.4% and 25.7%, respectively, at the end of 2017 (see 
Chart B). 1, 2 and 5 euro cent coins together accounted for only 6.7% of the total value in circulation, 
although they made up 64.1% of the number of coins in circulation. The high production requirements

for the 1 and 2 euro cent coins compared to their limited active use in circulation has led to the 
introduction of rounding rules in some euro area countries. 83

Notes: The latest observations are for 31 December 2017. 

In order to better understand how the 1 and 2 cent coins are used, the ECB included a question on 
what people do with 1 and 2 euro cent coins received as change in the 2016 survey on the use of 
cash. The results are illustrated in Chart C. According to these results, 37% of the respondents 
reported that they don’t use these coins when they receive them as change, with most of them putting 

83  In Ireland (since October 2015), in the Netherlands (since September 2004) and in Belgium (since 2014), 
retailers are free to decide whether they wish to round cash payments to the nearest 5 cents, although 
they are reluctant to apply it in the third country. In Finland, the rounding rule has been mandatory since 
the launch of the euro. In Malta, the implementation of a rounding rule is being examined. The Italian Mint 
discontinued the production of 1 and 2 cent euro coins in January 2018.

them in a jar or box at home. Slightly less than two-thirds of the respondents (63%) stated that they 
use them for subsequent payments. As with all aspects of payment behaviour, the use of 1 and 2 cent 
coins varies greatly from country to country. Logically, in those countries in which rounding rules have 
been introduced fewer people tend to use the 1 and 2 cent coins if they happen to receive them.

Conclusions 

In recent years, euro banknote circulation has shown robust average growth 

above GDP. The demand for banknotes is determined by various factors, one of which 
is the use for transaction purposes. The results of a study on payment behaviour in 
2016 showed that cash was still the most frequently used method of payment at POS 
in the euro area. Transaction demand, however, appears to only partially explain the 
growth in banknote circulation. The demand for banknotes has also been impacted by 
various additional factors such as the financial and sovereign debt crises, geopolitical 
uncertainties, exchange rate developments and policy decisions 

Cash can be expected to remain an important means of payment at POS in most 
euro area countries for the foreseeable future. Nevertheless, the rapid rise in the 

use of contactless cards and mobile payments, the increase in online shopping and 
the development of instant payments, on the basis of which new retail payment 
solutions may emerge, can all be expected to have a noticeable impact on the use of 
cash for transaction purposes. Although the speed of a subsequent decline in the use 
of cash for transaction purposes cannot be predicted, it seems obvious that it will 
occur. As described in this article, however, the use of cash for transaction purposes is 
only one driver of banknote demand. 

ECB Economic Bulletin, Issue 6 / 2018 – Articles 
Trends and developments in the use of euro cash over the past ten years 

108 

 
 
Most euro banknotes in circulation are used as a store of value in the euro area 

or held abroad. Considering that the opportunity costs of holding cash are currently 
low, if interest rates increase some of the stored euro banknotes can be expected to 
return. The fall in net shipments of euro banknotes to countries outside the euro area 
shows that some of the cash that was held abroad for various reasons is very 
gradually coming back. However, as shown by developments over the past ten years, 
the store of value function is determined not only by interest rates, but also by external 
events which cannot be predicted. While future developments may, therefore, lead to 
an increase or decrease in the use of cash as a store of value depending on users’ 
trust in the euro, current developments suggest that euro banknotes are considered a 
reliable means of holding liquidity and storing wealth, both within the euro area and 
abroad. Households and firms both inside and outside the euro area obviously value 
the fact that euro banknotes allow them to store part of their assets in central bank 
money.

1) Based on four-quarter cumulated sums of both saving and gross disposable income (adjusted for the change in the net equity of households in pension fund reserves).
2) Financial assets (net of financial liabilities) and non-financial assets. Non-financial assets consist mainly of housing wealth (residential structures and land). They also include
non-financial assets of unincorporated enterprises classified within the household sector.
3) The profit share uses net entrepreneurial income, which is broadly equivalent to current profits in business accounting. 
4) Based on the outstanding amount of loans, debt securities, trade credits and pension scheme liabilities.
