Update on economic and monetary 
developments 

Summary 

The incoming information that has become available since the Governing Council’s 
monetary policy meeting in September, while somewhat weaker than expected, 
remains overall consistent with an ongoing broad-based expansion of the euro area 
economy and gradually rising inflation pressures. The risks surrounding the euro area 
growth outlook can still be assessed as broadly balanced. At the same time, risks 
relating to protectionism, vulnerabilities in emerging markets and financial market 
volatility remain prominent. Yet, the underlying strength of the economy continues to 
support the Governing Council’s confidence that the sustained convergence of 
inflation to its aim will continue in the period ahead and will be maintained even after a 
gradual winding-down of the net asset purchases. Nevertheless, significant monetary 
policy stimulus is still needed to support the further build-up of domestic price 
pressures and headline inflation developments over the medium term. This support 
will continue to be provided by the net asset purchases until the end of the year, by the 
sizeable stock of acquired assets and the associated reinvestments, and by the 
Governing Council’s enhanced forward guidance on the key ECB interest rates. In any 
event, the Governing Council stands ready to adjust all of its instruments as 
appropriate to ensure that inflation continues to move towards its aim in a sustained 
manner. 

Survey indicators of global economic growth have weakened recently as the global 
economic cycle matures. The global trade momentum has moderated amid ongoing 
actions and threats regarding trade tariff increases by the United States and possible 
retaliation by affected countries, but the near-term outlook remains steady. Global 
financial conditions remain supportive for advanced economies, while creating 
headwinds for emerging market economies. 

In the euro area, sovereign bond yields have risen amid an increase in global risk-free 
rates and rising tensions in the sovereign debt markets of some euro area countries. 
Euro area equity prices have declined, reflecting a deterioration in risk sentiment. By 
contrast, yield spreads on corporate bonds have remained broadly unchanged. In 
foreign exchange markets, the euro has been broadly stable in trade-weighted terms. 

Euro area real GDP increased by 0.4%, quarter on quarter, in both the first and the 
second quarter of 2018. Looking ahead, the incoming information remains overall 
consistent with the Governing Council’s baseline scenario of an ongoing broad-based 
economic expansion. However, some recent sector-specific developments are having 
an impact on the near-term growth profile. The ECB’s monetary policy measures 
continue to underpin domestic demand. Private consumption is fostered by ongoing 
employment growth and rising wages. Business investment is supported by solid 
domestic demand, favourable financing conditions and corporate profitability. Housing

investment remains robust. In addition, the expansion in global activity is expected to 
continue supporting euro area exports, though at a slower pace. 

Euro area annual HICP inflation increased to 2.1% in September 2018, from 2.0% in 
August, reflecting mainly higher energy and food price inflation. On the basis of current 
futures prices for oil, annual rates of headline inflation are likely to hover around the 
current level over the coming months. While measures of underlying inflation remain 
generally muted, they have been increasing from earlier lows. Domestic cost 
pressures are strengthening and broadening amid high levels of capacity utilisation 
and tightening labour markets. Looking ahead, underlying inflation is expected to pick 
up towards the end of the year and to increase further over the medium term, 
supported by the ECB’s monetary policy measures, the ongoing economic expansion 
and rising wage growth. 

The monetary analysis shows that broad money (M3) growth stood at 3.5% in 
September 2018, after 3.4% in August. The growth of loans to the private sector has 
strengthened further, continuing the upward trend observed since the beginning of 
2014. The euro area bank lending survey for the third quarter of 2018 indicates that 
loan growth continues to be supported by increasing demand across all loan 
categories and favourable bank lending conditions for loans to enterprises and loans 
for house purchase. 

Combining the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the 
monetary analysis, the Governing Council concluded that an ample degree of 
monetary accommodation is still necessary for the continued sustained convergence 
of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. 

On the basis of this assessment, the Governing Council decided to keep the key ECB 
interest rates unchanged and continues to expect them to remain at their present 
levels at least through the summer of 2019, and in any case for as long as necessary 
to ensure the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but 
close to, 2% over the medium term. Regarding non-standard monetary policy 
measures, the Governing Council confirmed that the Eurosystem will continue to 
make net purchases under the asset purchase programme (APP) at the new monthly 
pace of €15 billion until the end of December 2018. The Governing Council anticipates 
that, subject to incoming data confirming its medium-term inflation outlook, net 
purchases will then end. The Governing Council intends to reinvest the principal 
payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period 
of time after the end of the net asset purchases, and in any case for as long as 
necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of 
monetary accommodation.

External environment 

Global survey indicators of economic growth have weakened recently as the 

global economic cycle matures. The global composite output Purchasing 
Managers’ Index (PMI) excluding the euro area declined further below its long-term 
average in September (see Chart 1), reaching a two-year low. The decline was driven 
by both the manufacturing and the services components. In quarterly terms, the 
average PMI for the third quarter of 2018 declined from its level in the previous quarter. 
The composite output PMI decreased across most advanced economies, including 
the United States, Japan and the United Kingdom. In emerging market economies, it 
increased in India but weakened in China, Russia and Brazil, the latter country index 
remaining below the expansionary threshold.

Notes: The latest observations are for September 2018. “Long-term average” refers to the period from January 1999 to September 2018. 

Risks to the global economy remain to the downside, amid ongoing actions and 
threats regarding trade tariff increases by the United States and possible 

retaliation by the affected countries. The US administration implemented tariffs 
targeting an additional USD 200 billion of Chinese imports with effect from 24 
September 2018, and China retaliated with tariffs targeting an additional USD 60 
billion of exports from the United States. Given the size of these latest measures, 
uncertainty as to their impact has increased, in particular as regards business 
sentiment and capital spending plans. Policy uncertainty also remains high. While the 
United States is weighing additional tariffs on Chinese exports and an expansion of 
protectionist measures in the automotive sector, a new trade agreement between the 
United States, Mexico and Canada (USMCA) signals an easing of trade tensions. 
Overall, the risks to global growth from rising protectionism remain significant. 

Global financial conditions remain supportive for advanced economies, while 
creating headw inds for emerging market economies. Overall, monetary policy in 

advanced economies remains accommodative. At the same time, in the United States

the Federal Open Market Committee increased policy rates in September amid solid 
growth, rising inflation and a tight labour market. Following the decision, the yield on 
10-year US government bonds reached its highest level since 2011, while international 
equity markets fell sharply. In China, financial conditions eased following action by the 
People’s Bank of China responding to a weakening outlook for economic activity amid 
rising trade tensions. More broadly, however, financial conditions in emerging market 
economies remain tight and weigh on the outlook for economic activity. Overall, global 
risk sentiment has not fully recovered over the past few months, and financial 
investors seem to increasingly discriminate against emerging market economies with 
significant imbalances, high external financing needs and limited room for policy 
support. Moreover, additional rate increases in the United States and the stronger 
dollar could lead to a further tightening of financial conditions across emerging market 
economies. 

The global trade momentum has moderated, but the near-term outlook remains 

steady. Following very weak figures in the second quarter of the year, global 
merchandise imports further recovered in August on account of stronger imports by 
emerging market economies (see Chart 2). The global PMI for new export orders 
decreased to below expansionary territory in September; however, the average for the 
third quarter of the year remained above the neutral threshold. Other trade indicators 
give mixed signals. Overall, recent data point to moderate but steady growth in trade in 
the third quarter.

Note: The latest observations are for August 2018 for global merchandise imports and September 2018 for the PMIs. 

Global inflation was stable in August. Annual consumer price inflation in the 
countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) 
was unchanged at 2.9% in August, while inflation excluding food and energy stood at 
2.1%. Looking ahead, global inflationary pressures are expected to remain contained. 
While upward pressures from oil prices should diminish in the medium term, the 
gradual decline in spare economic capacity is expected to support underlying inflation.

Oil markets have been mainly affected by factors related to the US sanctions 

against Iran. Brent crude oil prices increased from a low of USD 70 per barrel in the 
summer to USD 86 per barrel on 3 October as the prospect of the sanctions started to 
affect Iranian oil exports and OPEC decided not to further increase production. The 
more recent retreat in oil prices to USD 76 per barrel on October 23 was driven by the 
announcements by Saudi Arabia and Russia that they could increase output if 
needed, coupled with a global stock market sell-off and weaker forecasts for oil 
demand growth. Non-oil commodity prices have decreased by around 2% since 
end-July. While food prices fell slightly, metal prices increased, mainly on account of 
iron ore prices. 

In the United States, the outlook for economic activity remains solid. Real GDP 

expanded at an annualised rate of 4.2% in the second quarter of 2018, following 2.2% 
in the previous quarter. This marked acceleration was due in part to strong exports. To 
the extent that these exports were front-loaded in response to expected future tariffs, 
the support from trade is not expected to persist. In addition, the further escalation of 
trade tensions between the United States and China may increasingly affect business 
sentiment and thus investment spending. Nonetheless, the near-term outlook remains 
strong, supported by solid macroeconomic fundamentals, as well as a large 
procyclical fiscal expansion. Meanwhile, the labour market continued to generate jobs 
at a robust pace in September, and the unemployment rate declined further to 3.7%, 
the lowest rate since December 1969. Annual headline consumer price index (CPI) 
inflation slowed to 2.3% in September, while excluding food and energy, inflation 
remained at 2.2%. 

In Japan, economic activity was robust in the second quarter, but extreme 
weather conditions have raised uncertainty regarding the outlook. Following a 

mild contraction in the first quarter of the year, economic activity rebounded in the 
second quarter, supported by strong investment activity. However, the outlook 
continues to be surrounded by growing uncertainty. Following the heavy rains and 
floods in western Japan in July, the impact of Typhoon Jebi and the Hokkaido 
earthquake in September are likely to weigh on economic activity. Looking further 
ahead, the Japanese economy is expected to return to moderate growth, albeit at a 
gradually slowing pace, as declining spare capacity and diminishing fiscal support 
may limit growth prospects in spite of accommodative monetary policy. In addition, the 
political uncertainty regarding trade policies remains significant, especially as regards 
potential tariffs on Japan’s automotive sector. Labour market indicators, meanwhile, 
point to a further tightening, while upward momentum in prices and wages remains 
limited. Annual headline CPI inflation stood at 1.2% in September, while CPI inflation 
excluding food and energy remained close to zero. 

In the United Kingdom, real GDP growth rebounded modestly in the second 

quarter. Real GDP grew by 0.4% quarter on quarter in the second quarter, after first 
quarter growth was revised down to 0.1%. Household consumption slowed, while the 
investment and trade expenditure components were revised heavily downwards, 
revealing contractions in both for two consecutive quarters. The latest PMI survey data 
suggest quarter-on-quarter GDP growth at a similar rate in the third quarter, though 
short-term indicators for the export-oriented manufacturing sector signal a less

optimistic outlook. This is in line with an environment of moderating global growth, 
growing trade tensions and the heightened uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the 
negotiations on the country’s withdrawal from membership of the European Union in 
March 2019. Having picked up slightly over the course of the summer, inflation fell 
back to 2.4% in September, from 2.7% in August. The volatility seen over the summer 
months was in large part expected, reflecting earlier developments in oil prices and a 
slight weakening in the pound around the end of the second quarter of the year. 

In China, GDP growth moderated only slightly in the third quarter of 2018, amid 

additional policy support. Real GDP grew at 6.5% in year-on-year terms in the third 
quarter of 2018, supported by strong consumption, government policy support and a 
solid export performance. However, in the near term a slowing housing market and the 
lagged effects of earlier financial tightening may weigh on growth. Also, new tariffs 
implemented by the US administration targeting an additional USD 200 billion of 
Chinese exports to the United States are expected to adversely impact economic 
activity. In order to mitigate the impact, the Chinese authorities have announced a 
broad set of non-tariff measures to facilitate trade growth and foster domestic 
investment. In addition, Chinese policymakers are set to lower the average tariff rate 
on imports from 9.8% in 2017 to 7.5% as of 1 November. Headline CPI inflation 
increased slightly in September to 2.5%, but core inflation declined to 1.7%.

Financial developments 

Euro area government bond yields have risen since mid-September (see 

Chart 3). In the period under review (from 13 September to 24 October 2018), the 
GDP-weighted euro area ten-year sovereign bond yield rose by 18 basis points to 
1.28% amid an increase in global risk-free rates and rising tensions in the sovereign 
debt markets of some euro area countries. Vis-à-vis the yield on German ten-year 
government bonds, the spread on ten-year Italian sovereign bonds widened by 86 
basis points to 3.22%. The spreads on the equivalent bonds of Spain and Portugal 
widened to a somewhat lesser extent. Sovereign bond yields increased by 20 basis 
points to 3.17% in the United States and declined by 3 basis points to 1.48% in the 
United Kingdom.

Notes: Daily data. The vertical grey line denotes the start of the review period (i.e. 13 September 2018). The latest observation is for 24 
October 2018. 

Broad indices of euro area equity prices declined. Equity prices of both euro area 

financials and non-financial corporations (NFCs) decreased by around 7% over the 
review period on the back of an increase in the discount rate and in risk premia in the 
light of tensions in euro area sovereign bond markets. However, expectations of 
robust corporate profits continued to be supportive of euro area equity prices. The 
equity prices of US NFCs and financial firms also declined over the review period, by 
6% and 7.5% respectively. In view of the declines, market expectations of future equity 
price volatility increased in both the euro area and the United States, where they stood 
on an annualised basis at 21.5% and 21% respectively. These levels remain 
comparatively low from a historical perspective. 

Yield spreads on bonds issued by euro area NFCs remained relatively insulated 
from tensions in sovereign debt and equity markets. Compared with 

mid-September, the spread on investment-grade NFC bonds relative to the risk-free 
rate fell by 3 basis points to 64 basis points. Spreads on financial sector debt with an 
investment-grade rating increased by 3 basis points to 93 basis points. Despite yield

increases in the first half of 2018, corporate bond spreads remained significantly 
(50-60 basis points) below the levels observed in March 2016, prior to the 
announcement and subsequent launch of the corporate sector purchase programme. 

The euro overnight index average (EONIA) ranged between -35 and -37 basis 

points over the period under review. Excess liquidity declined by around €37 billion 
to about €1,867 billion. This decline was driven by an increase in net autonomous 
factors, the maturity of the first series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations 
(TLTRO-I) and some early repayments of funds borrowed under the second series 
(TLTRO-II). At the same time, ongoing purchases under the Eurosystem’s asset 
purchase programme partially offset the decline in excess liquidity. 

The EONIA forward curve shifted slightly upwards over the review period. 
Market participants revised up their interest rate expectations for longer 

horizons. The curve remains below zero for horizons prior to October 2020, reflecting 
market expectations of a prolonged period of negative interest rates. 

In the foreign exchange markets, the euro depreciated in trade-weighted terms 

(see Chart 4). Over the period under review, the effective exchange rate of the euro, 
measured against the currencies of 38 of the euro area’s most important trading 
partners, weakened by 1.4%. In bilateral terms, the euro depreciated against the 
currencies of the major advanced economies, in particular the US dollar (by 2.0%), 
reflecting expectations about the evolution of monetary policy in the United States and 
the euro area, the Japanese yen (by1.0%) and the pound sterling (by 0.9%). The euro 
also depreciated vis-à-vis the currencies of most non-euro area EU Member States, 
as well as against the Chinese renminbi (by 0.6) and the currencies of other major 
emerging economies, such as Turkey, Russia and Brazil, which were supported by 
improving market sentiment following their previous significant depreciation. Over the 
same period, the euro strengthened vis-à-vis the Swiss franc by 1.0%.

Economic activity 

Incoming information, while somewhat weaker than expected, remains overall 
consistent w ith ongoing broad-based economic expansion. Real GDP increased 

by 0.4%, quarter on quarter, in both the first and second quarters of the year, following 
the exceptionally strong dynamics observed in the previous five quarters (see 
Chart 5). Domestic demand made a positive contribution to the outcome in the second 
quarter, whereas net trade and changes in inventories had a neutral impact on GDP 
growth. Economic indicators, with survey results overall remaining at high levels, point 
to ongoing growth in the second half of the year.

Notes: The Economic Sentiment Indicator (ESI) is standardised and rescaled to have the same mean and standard deviation as the 
Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI). The latest observations are for the second quarter of 2018 for real GDP, September 2018 for the ESI 
and October 2018 for the PMI. 

In the second quarter employment rose further across euro area countries and 
sectors, increasing by 0.4% quarter on quarter. The average hours worked 

increased markedly in the second quarter, recovering from the decline due to the 
temporary impact of sick leave and strikes in the previous quarter. 1 W ith the latest 
increase, employment stands 2.4% above the pre-crisis peak recorded in the first 
quarter of 2008. Since the trough recorded in the second quarter of 2013, cumulative 
employment growth in the euro area amounts to 9.2 million persons. The strong 
growth in employment seen during this period of economic expansion was 
accompanied by broadly unchanged average hours worked, which primarily reflects 
the impact of several structural factors (e.g. the large share of part-time workers in 
total employment). 

Looking ahead, short-term indicators point to continued strength in the labour 

market in the coming quarters. The euro area headline unemployment rate declined

further to 8.1% in August (see Chart 6) – the lowest level seen since November 2008. 
Looking further ahead, survey indicators point to continued employment growth in the 
third quarter of the year.

Notes: The Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) is expressed as a deviation from 50 divided by 10. The latest observations are for the 
second quarter of 2018 for employment, October 2018 for the PMI and August 2018 for the unemployment rate. 

Household income continued to support growth in private consumption. Private 

consumption rose by 0.2%, quarter on quarter, in the second quarter of 2018, following 
more dynamic growth in the previous quarter. This slowdown appears to reflect, on the 
one hand, adverse temporary factors (such as the impact of strikes on 
transport-related spending in France) and, on the other hand, the unwinding of 
positive temporary factors in the first quarter (higher energy consumption due to the 
cold winter). On an annual basis, consumption rose by 1.3% in the second quarter of 
2018, which represents a slowdown from the first quarter, when consumption rose by 
1.6%. At the same time, annual growth of households’ real disposable income 
increased from 1.7% in the first quarter to 1.9% in the second quarter. Thus, the 
slowdown in consumption growth was mirrored by a rise in the annual rate of change 
in savings – from 3.4% in the first quarter to 5.9% in the second quarter. The 
household saving ratio rose to 12.0% in the second quarter, slightly above the record 
low of 11.9% in the previous three quarters. 

Private consumption is expected to display resilient growth in the coming 

quarters. Recent data on the volume of retail sales and new passenger car 
registrations point to ongoing growth in consumer spending in the third quarter of this 
year. However, it should be noted that the link between new passenger car 
registrations and car purchases, which feed into private consumption, is in all 
likelihood distorted at the current juncture, as it appears that a large part of the 
registrations in August were carried out by manufacturers/dealers rather than 
consumers. Other indicators also support the picture of continued robust consumption 
dynamics. For instance, households’ net worth continued to increase at robust rates in 
the second quarter, thus lending further support to private consumption. Moreover, the

Economic activity 

11 

 
 
 
latest survey results signal further labour market improvements, which should 
continue to support aggregate income and thus consumer spending. In addition, 
although consumer confidence has declined in the course of 2018, it still stands at an 
elevated level and well above its long-term average. 

Follow ing the weak first quarter of 2018, investment growth rebounded in the 

second quarter. The quarterly 1.4% rise in investment in the second quarter of this 
year was brought about by an increase in investment in machinery, equipment and, to 
a lesser extent, intellectual property products (Box 2 provides an overview of 
developments in investment in intangible assets in the euro area). At the same time, 
quarterly growth in construction investment increased to 1.1%. By contrast, 
investment in transport equipment declined strongly in the same quarter. For the third 
quarter of 2018, short-term indicators point to continued growth. Monthly data on 
capital goods production in July and August stood, on average, 0.7% above their 
second quarter average, when they rose by 0.8% on a quarterly basis. On the other 
hand, indicators such as capacity utilisation (slightly declining but still high), 
confidence and orders (both lower) point to some downward risks to the growth 
momentum in non-construction investment. W ith regard to construction investment, 
monthly construction production data up to August point to continued – but moderating 
– growth in the third quarter of 2018. 

Investment is expected to continue to grow solidly, supported by robust 
domestic demand and favourable financing conditions. According to the euro 

area sectoral accounts for the second quarter of 2018, business margins (measured 
as the ratio of net operating surplus to net value added) have remained broadly 
unchanged since the end of 2015 and continue to be close to long-term averages. 
However, uncertainties surrounding the future implementation of tariff increases may 
already be proving detrimental to investment decisions. As regards construction 
investment, households’ increasing intentions to buy or renovate, as well as 
constructors’ buoyant price and employment expectations, point to positive 
momentum in the construction sector over the short-term horizon. However, as 
financing conditions are expected to become slightly tighter, alternative long-term 
investment opportunities may gradually emerge. 

Euro area trade growth remained moderate at the beginning of the third quarter 

of 2018. Based on information up to August, euro area nominal goods exports 
increased by 1.1% quarter on quarter, slightly below the figures registered in the 
second quarter of 2018 (1.3% quarter on quarter). In contrast, extra euro area goods 
exports rebounded in August (an increase of 2.1%, after a contraction of around 1.1% 
in July), suggesting some acceleration compared with the second quarter in 
quarter-on-quarter terms. Euro area nominal imports fell by 0.2%, month on month, in 
August, after increasing by 0.9% in July. Using information up to August, extra-euro 
area imports increased by 2.8% in nominal terms in the third quarter, reflecting an 
acceleration compared with the second quarter of 2018 (2.2% quarter on quarter). 
Survey indicators with leading properties, such as the Purchasing Managers’ Index 
(PMI) for new manufacturing export orders, and the European Commission’s 
assessment of export order book levels are consistent with a deterioration in export 
performance, showing a decline in October in the context of a downward trend since 

ECB Economic Bulletin, Issue 7 / 2018 – Update on economic and monetary developments 
Economic activity 

12 

 
 
the beginning of the year. Hard data such as new manufacturing orders outside the 
euro area rebounded in August after some deterioration in June and July. 

Overall, the latest economic indicators suggest ongoing broad–based growth. 

Industrial production (excluding construction) rebounded and recorded a relatively 
strong increase in August, following the sharp declines of the previous two months. 
Still, on average, production in July and August stood 0.2% below the level seen in the 
second quarter of 2018, when it rose by 0.1% on a quarterly basis. This weakness 
partly relates to temporary bottlenecks in the production of cars triggered by the 
testing process following the introduction of the Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle 
Test Procedure (WLTP) on 1 September. More timely survey data signal ongoing 
robust growth at rates similar to, or somewhat lower than, those recorded in the first 
half of the year. The composite output PMI averaged 54.3 in the third quarter, 
compared with 54.7 in the second quarter, before declining in October to 52.7. 
Meanwhile, the European Commission’s Economic Sentiment Indicator (ESI) eased to 
112.5 in the third quarter, from 114.0 in the second quarter (see Chart 5). Both the PMI 
and the ESI continue to stand above their respective long-term averages. 

The economic expansion is supported by domestic demand and continued 

improvements in the labour market. However, some recent sector-specific 
developments are having an impact on the near-term growth profile. The ECB’s 
monetary policy measures continue to underpin domestic demand. Private 
consumption is fostered by ongoing employment growth and rising wages. At the 
same time, business investment is supported by solid domestic demand, favourable 
financing conditions and corporate profitability. Housing investment remains robust. In 
addition, the expansion in global activity is expected to continue supporting euro area 
exports, although at a slower pace. The results of the latest round of the ECB Survey 
of Professional Forecasters, conducted in early October, show that private sector GDP 
growth forecasts were revised downwards for 2018 and 2019 compared with the 
previous round conducted in early July. The figure for 2020 remained unchanged. 

The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook are assessed as broadly 

balanced. At the same time, risks relating to protectionism, vulnerabilities in emerging 
markets and financial market volatility remain prominent.

Prices and costs 

Euro area annual HICP inflation was 2.1% in September, up from 2.0% in August 

(see Chart 7). This increase reflected slightly higher contributions from food and 
energy price inflation, while the contributions of services and non-energy industrial 
goods price inflation were unchanged. Energy prices made a large contribution to 
headline inflation over recent months. The contribution varies significantly across euro 
area countries, due partly to differences in the degree of pass-through of oil prices to 
consumer energy prices (see the box entitled “The role of energy prices in recent 
inflation outcomes: a cross-country perspective” in this issue of the Economic 
Bulletin).

Note: The latest observations are for September 2018. 

Measures of underlying inflation have remained generally muted but stand 

above earlier lows. HICP inflation excluding energy and food was 0.9% in 
September, the same as in August (revised down from an initial 1.0%). Over the same 
period, HICP inflation excluding energy, food and highly volatile components, such as 
travel-related items, clothing and footwear, was stable. Sideways developments over 
recent months were also highlighted by two model-based measures of underlying 
inflation, the Persistent and Common Component of Inflation indicator and the 
Supercore indicator. Nonetheless, each of the statistical and model-based measures 
remained higher than their respective lows in 2016. 

Supply chain price pressures for non-energy industrial goods in the HICP 

continued to increase. The annual inflation rate for imported non-food consumer 
goods increased to -0.4% in July, up from its recent trough of -2.7% in April. Producer 
price inflation for domestic sales of non-food consumer goods increased from 0.5% in 

ECB Economic Bulletin, Issue 7 / 2018 – Update on economic and monetary developments 
Prices and costs

June to 0.6% in July and August. 2 This was the highest outturn since late 2012, 
marking a continuation in the pick-up from the low of around 0.0% on average in 2016. 
Such resilience to downward pressure from the strong appreciation of the euro in 2017 
may reflect the offsetting impact of strengthening domestic cost pressures. Price 
pressures remained strong in earlier stages of the supply chain; producer price 
inflation for intermediate goods was 3.2% in August, the same rate as in July. 

Wage growth developments point to increasing domestic cost pressures. All the 

main sectors and most euro area countries contributed to the increase in annual 
growth in compensation per employee over recent quarters. This broad-based rise in 
wage growth, together with information on negotiated wage agreements covering the 
next one to two years, supports the expectation of a further pick-up. Overall, recent 
developments in wage growth have followed the direction of improving labour market 
conditions, as other factors that have weighed on wage growth – including past low 
inflation and the impact of labour market reforms implemented in some countries 
during the crisis – continue to fade. 

Both market and survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations 

have remained stable (see Chart 8). On 24 October the five-year inflation-linked 
swap rate five years ahead stood at 1.67%. The forward profile of market-based 
measures of inflation expectations continues to point to a gradual return of inflation to 
levels below, but close to, 2%. The risk-neutral probability of deflation over the next 
five years implied by inflation options markets remains negligible. The results of the 
ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) for the fourth quarter of 2018 show 
average headline inflation expectations of 1.7% for each of 2018, 2019 and 2020. This 
is unchanged from the profile in the previous survey. According to the SPF, average 
longer-term inflation expectations for the euro area continued to stay at 1.9%. 

2 Euro area producer price indices for August 2018 do not include data for Germany, which were only 
published after the release of euro area indices due to the incorporation of new index weights. The 
November release of euro area producer price indices for September 2018 will include new and revised 
data for Germany; euro area indices will be revised accordingly.

referred to 2022, whereas in the SPF for the third and fourth quarter of 2018 it referred to 2023. 

Residential property prices in the euro area continued to rise in the second 

quarter of 2018. According to the ECB’s residential property price indicator, prices for 
houses and flats in the euro area increased by 4.1% year on year in the second 
quarter of 2018, down from 4.3% in the first quarter of 2018, confirming a further 
consolidation of the house price cycle.

Money and credit 

Broad money growth remained broadly stable in September. The annual growth 

rate of M3 interrupted the decline from its last peak (5.2%) in September 2017, 
increasing to 3.5% in September from 3.4% in August (see Chart 9) owing to a 
significant inflow into overnight deposits. Moreover, the reduction in net asset 
purchases (from €80 billion to €60 billion in April 2017, and then to €30 billion in 
January 2018) has meant that the asset purchase programme (APP) is having a 
smaller positive impact on M3 growth. The annual growth rate of M1, which includes 
the most liquid components of M3, again made a significant contribution to broad 
money growth and increased to 6.8% in September (up from 6.4% in August). Money 
growth continued to be bolstered by sustained economic expansion and the low 
opportunity cost of holding the most liquid instruments in an environment of very low 
interest rates.

Notes: Credit to the private sector includes monetary financial institution (MFI) loans to the private sector and MFI holdings of securities 
issued by the euro area private non-MFI sector. As such, it also covers the Eurosystem’s purchases of non-MFI debt securities under the 
corporate sector purchase programme. The latest observation is for September 2018. 

Domestic sources of money creation remained the main driver of broad money 

growth. From a counterpart perspective, there was a further decline in the positive 
contribution to M3 growth from general government securities held by the Eurosystem 
(see the red parts of the bars in Chart 9), in the context of the aforementioned 
reduction in monthly net purchases under the APP. The decreasing contribution to M3 
growth from the Eurosystem’s asset purchases has been offset by a moderate 
increase in the contribution from credit to the private sector since late 2017 (see the 
blue parts of the bars in Chart 9). By contrast, government bond sales by euro area 
MFIs excluding the Eurosystem dampened M3 growth (see the light green parts of the 
bars in Chart 9). Finally, the negative contribution from net external assets, which 
reflects both global uncertainty and investors’ preferences, moderated in September 
(see the yellow parts of the bars in Chart 9).

The growth of loans to the private sector strengthened further, continuing the 
upward trend observed since the beginning of 2014. The annual growth rate of 

MFI loans to the private sector (adjusted for loan sales, securitisation and notional 
cash pooling) was stable in September at 3.4% (see Chart 10). It benefitted from an 
increase in the annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations (NFCs), 
which reached 4.3% in September, up from 4.1% in August. At the same time, the 
annual growth rate of loans to households remained stable at 3.1%. While the annual 
growth rate of loans to households for house purchase remained moderate from a 
historical perspective, loan origination was strong. The recovery in loan growth has 
been supported by the significant decline in bank lending rates across the euro area 
since mid-2014 (notably owing to the ECB’s non-standard monetary policy measures) 
and by overall improvements in the supply of, and demand for, bank loans. In addition, 
banks have made progress in consolidating their balance sheets, although the volume 
of non-performing loans (NPLs) remains high in some countries and may constrain 
financial intermediation. 3

Notes: Loans are adjusted for loan sales, securitisation and notional cash pooling. The latest observation is for September 2018. 

Loan growth continued to be supported by easing credit standards and 
increasing demand in the third quarter of 2018. According to the October 2018 

euro area bank lending survey, the net easing of credit standards was driven mainly by 
competitive pressure and lower risk perceptions. Banks also reported increasing net 
loan demand across all loan categories, which is largely due to the low general level of 
interest rates, fixed investment, inventories and working capital, merger and 
acquisition (M&A) activity, favourable housing market prospects and consumer 
confidence. W ith regard to the APP, banks stated that it had improved their liquidity 
position and market financing conditions, but that it had negatively affected their 
profitability owing to the squeeze on net interest rate margins. The APP had an easing 
impact on credit terms and conditions across all loan categories. Moreover, it had a 
positive impact on banks’ lending volumes, but less than in the previous reporting

period. Furthermore, the ECB’s negative deposit facility rate was said to be having a 
positive effect on lending volumes, while weighing on banks’ net interest income. 

Very favourable lending rates continued to support euro area economic growth. 

In August 2018 the composite bank lending rate for loans to NFCs remained broadly 
stable at 1.65%, which is very close to its historical low seen in May of this year. The 
composite bank lending rate for housing loans remained stable in August at 1.81%, 
which is also close to its historical low from December 2016 (see Chart 11). Composite 
bank lending rates for loans to NFCs and households have fallen significantly and by 
more than market reference rates since the ECB’s credit easing measures were 
announced in June 2014. The reduction in bank lending rates on loans to NFCs, as 
well as on loans to small firms (assuming that very small loans of up to €0.25 million 
are granted mainly to small firms), was particularly significant in those euro area 
countries that were most exposed to the financial crisis. This indicates a more uniform 
transmission of monetary policy to bank lending rates across euro area countries and 
firm sizes.

Notes: Composite bank lending rates are calculated by aggregating short and long-term rates using a 24-month moving average of new 
business volumes. The latest observation is for August 2018. 

Net issuance of debt securities by euro area NFCs declined in the first two 
months of the third quarter of 2018 compared w ith the equivalent months in the 

previous quarter. The latest ECB data indicate that, on a net basis, the total flow of 
debt securities issued by NFCs in July and August 2018 remained marginally positive 
and in line with the typical seasonal patterns observed over the last few years. From a 
more medium-term perspective (see Chart 12), the annual flows of debt securities 
continued to decline from the peaks reached around a year ago. Available market data 
suggest there was a considerable increase in the amount of debt securities issued 
over the period from September to October 2018. Total net issuance of quoted shares 
by NFCs was negative in July and August 2018, in line with the seasonal pattern of the 
series. Notwithstanding a slight decline in August relative to the previous month, 
annual flows remained close to the highest levels recorded since 2012.

Notes: Monthly figures based on a 12-month rolling period. The latest observation is for August 2018. 

Financing costs for euro area NFCs increased marginally in the first two 

months of the third quarter of 2018. The overall nominal cost of external financing 
for NFCs, comprising bank lending, debt issuance in the market and equity finance, 
rose to around 4.7% in August, up from 4.6% in June, and is projected to have 
remained at this level in September and October. Although the cost of financing is 
currently estimated to stand around 41 basis points above the historical low of 
August 2016, it is still considerably below the levels observed in the summer of 2014. 
The increase in the cost of financing since the end of the second quarter of 2018 
reflects an increase in the cost of equity and, more recently, an increase in the cost of 
market-based debt. The cost of both short and long-term bank lending remained 
relatively stable over the same period.

Purchases of green bonds under the Eurosystem’s asset 
purchase programme 

Prepared by Roberto A. De Santis, Katja Hettler, Madelaine Roos and 
Fabio Tamburrini 

This box analyses the impact of the Eurosystem’s asset purchase programme 
(APP) on the grow ing market for green bonds 4. It describes the composition of the 

Eurosystem’s green bond holdings and assesses developments in prices and 
outstanding volumes of green bonds, before discussing the extent to which these may 
have been affected by the APP. 

The APP aims to support a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation that is 
consistent w ith the ECB’s primary objective of price stability, defined as an 
inflation rate below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Eligibility criteria for 

the APP are deliberately broad in order to provide a large range of purchasable 
securities. This supports the effectiveness of the programme and avoids distortions of 
specific market segments. The implementation of the APP is guided by the principle of 
market neutrality and does not positively or negatively discriminate on the basis of 
environmental or any other criteria. In the specific case of the corporate sector 
purchase programme (CSPP), which aims to further strengthen the pass-through of 
the benefits of the asset purchases to financing conditions in the real economy, the 
purchases of securities issued by non-bank corporations reflect proportionally the 
market value of all eligible bonds in terms of sectors of economic activity and rating 
groups. 

Despite the absence of an explicit environmental target in the APP, ECB has 
purchased green bonds under both the CSPP and the public sector purchase 

programme (PSPP). These purchases have contributed to the establishment of a 
well-diversified portfolio. 

The term “green bond” refers to debt securities whose proceeds are used to 
finance investment projects w ith an environmental benefit. There are different 

approaches to defining and certifying green bonds, and no global market standard has 
emerged so far. 5 While many green bonds are self-labelled, some jurisdictions have 
developed their own certification framework and others rely on various different 
guidelines. 6 As well as reducing transparency for investors, it is believed that the lack 
of standardised definitions and reporting requirements and the varying granularity of 

4  

In this box, “green bonds” are defined on the basis of the Bloomberg classification of the bonds’ use of 
proceeds, where proceeds are exclusively applied to new and existing green projects, defined as projects 
and activities that promote climate or other environmental sustainability purposes. 
5  For an overview of existing definitions and certifications, see Ehlers, T. and Packer, F., “Green bond 
finance and certification”, BIS Quarterly Review, September 2017.

the underlying classifications are holding back supply, 7 inter alia because issuers face 
reputational risks and potential accusations of “greenwashing” if proceeds are not 
used for their declared purposes. 8 The ECB supports current EU initiatives under the 
European Commission’s action plan on sustainable finance to create a harmonised 
definition of “green” assets (taxonomy), which could improve transparency and 
facilitate the supply of green debt instruments. 

The market for green bonds has developed rapidly in recent years, with global 

issuance rising from less than €1 billion in 2008 to more than €120 billion in 2017 (see 
Chart A, panel b). Euro-denominated net green bond issuance has increased ten-fold 
since 2013 (see Chart A, panel a). During the period 2013-2018, total net 
euro-denominated green investment grade issuance in the euro area represented 
around 24% of global net green issuance. However, despite the recent growth, in the 
same period green bonds still accounted for only 1% of the overall bond supply 
denominated in euro. Green bonds are not unlike other bonds in that they tend to price 
tighter than the initial price guidance and tend to be oversubscribed. They generally 
offer similar yields to comparable conventional bonds, but there is evidence that in 
some market segments issuers can borrow at lower rates than via conventional 
bonds, which is consistent with the interpretation that investors are prepared to forgo 
some income as a result of their self-imposed investment constraints. 9

Green bond purchases under the CSPP are broadly in line w ith the grow ing 
share of green bonds in the eligible universe. The CSPP-eligible green corporate 

bond universe currently has an outstanding volume of €31 billion (see Chart B, right 
panel), of which the Eurosystem holds close to 20% – in line with the 20% holding of 
the Eurosystem in the entire CSPP-eligible universe. In the overall CSPP-eligible 
universe, green bonds represent a small but growing segment, contributing around 
4% to the total (see Chart B, left panel). Looking more closely at the distribution by 
economic sector, green bond issuance is not evenly spread across industries and 
shows a significant concentration in carbon-intensive sectors, such as utilities, 
infrastructure, transportation and construction. 10 Companies in these sectors issue 
green bonds to finance the adoption of more efficient technologies, reduce their 
carbon footprints and reorient their energy portfolios towards renewable sources. 
While these sectors jointly account for 35% of overall bond issuance in the 
CSPP-eligible universe, they account for 94% of the CSPP-eligible green bond 

10  Based on internal ECB classifications. According to Eurostat data, utilities, infrastructure, transportation 
and construction accounted for 67% of total greenhouse gas emissions in the EU in 2015.

Since the CSPP announcement on 10 March 2016, green corporate bond 
spreads have steadily declined, and a significant part of this effect can be 

attributed to the Eurosystem’s purchases. In the industrial sector, the evolution of 
the average corporate bond spread for CSPP-eligible green bonds mirrors that for 
other CSPP-eligible bonds (see Chart C). The change in spreads for eligible green 
bonds in the period after the CSPP announcement (from 10 March 2016 to the end of 
December 2017) was compared with that in the period prior to the announcement (1 
April 2015 to 9 March 2016), controlling for other determinants that may affect 
corporate bond spreads, such as bond-specific credit risk. The CSPP accounted for an 
average decline in spreads for eligible green bonds of 25 basis points, which was 
almost the entire drop recorded after the announcement of the programme. Since the 
end of 2016, in conjunction with the simultaneous rapid growth in bond supply and the 
increase in green bond spreads globally, the gap between spreads of green bonds and 
those of the overall industrial sector have gradually closed, and the yields of green and 
conventional bonds have tightly co-moved since the end of 2017. 11  

11  The increase in green corporate bond spreads at the end of 2016 was due in part to technical factors. On 
10 October 2016 a new €1.75 billion issue from Electricité de France increased the volume-weighted 
average of green corporate bond spreads by six basis points from 25 to 31 basis points.

Extreme outliers for global green bond spreads were removed. The vertical lines denote the announcement of the CSPP on 10 March 
2016 (light grey line) and the start of purchases under the CSPP on 8 June 2016 (dark grey line). The latest observation is for 27 
September 2018. 

Issuance of green bonds picked up immediately after the announcement of the 
CSPP in March 2016 and has been rising ever since. The ratio of the amount 

outstanding of green bonds to the total amount outstanding in the industrial sector, 
including utilities, infrastructure, transportation and construction, has increased 
steadily since the announcement of the CSPP, from under 4% in March 2016 to over 
9% at the end of September 2018 (see Chart D). These results are consistent with 
previous findings on the impact of the CSPP on overall bond issuance by non-financial 
corporations, which increased after the announcement of the programme, particularly 
among eligible issuers. 12 These findings are corroborated by an analysis of the more 
homogenous utilities sector as well as for specific maturities. It should be noted, 
however, that this positive trend partly reflects a world-wide phenomenon, as green 
bond issuance has increased globally, from less than €10 billion in 2013 to almost 
€120 billion in 2017.

The Eurosystem has also purchased green bonds issued by sovereigns, 
agencies and supranational institutions since the start of the PSPP, with a 

grow ing presence over time. The volume of eligible green bonds issued by such 
public sector entities is small relative to the PSPP-eligible universe (less than 1%). 
While multilateral development banks such as the European Investment Bank and 
agencies like Kreditanstalt für W iederaufbau have a long history of issuing green 
bonds and account for a relative large share of the total issuance of PSPP-eligible 
green bonds (see Chart E, panel a), governments entered the green bond market only 
recently, with the French Treasury becoming the first euro area sovereign to issue a 
green bond in January 2017. Governments, however, show a tendency to tap the 
market on a large scale, exceeding the amounts that are issued by corporates in the 
same jurisdiction (see Chart E, panel b). Overall, green bonds issued by public sector 
entities contribute a volume of €48 billion to the PSPP-eligible universe, out of which 
the Eurosystem currently holds 24%, which is broadly in line with its total PSPP 
holdings of the entire PSPP universe and compares with a share of 15% in 2015. 

Overall, while the amount of green bonds held by the Eurosystem remains relatively 
small, evidence suggests that through its purchases the Eurosystem has reduced 
yields of green bonds and supported their issuance by non-financial corporations.

The geography of the euro area current account balance 

Prepared by Michael Fidora and Martin Schmitz 

The composition of the euro area current account balance in terms of its 
geographical counterparts has been fairly stable in recent years, w ith the euro 
area’s most important trading partners accounting for the largest part of the 
bilateral surpluses and deficits (see Chart A). Newly available data on the 

geographical breakdown of the euro area current account balance reveal that the 
largest share of the euro area’s external surplus of 3.5% of GDP in the year to the end 
of the second quarter of 2018 was accounted for by the United Kingdom and the 
United States, which contributed 1.4% and 1.0% of euro area GDP, respectively, 
followed by Switzerland (0.4% of euro area GDP). China, on the other hand, 
contributed negatively (about -0.6% of euro area GDP) to the current account balance 
of the euro area. At the same time, the impact of all other major trading partners for 
which a geographical breakdown is available was relatively limited, while a residual 
group of countries – including major oil producers – also contributed positively to the 
euro area’s external surplus (about 1.3% of euro area GDP).

Notes: “Q2 2018” refers to the four quarters to the end of the second quarter of 2018. “Other EU” comprises EU Member States and EU 
institutions outside the euro area, excluding the United Kingdom. 

The bulk of the increase in the euro area’s current account surplus of about 1.2 
percentage points of GDP since 2013 was accounted for by improvements 
vis-à-vis the euro area’s three largest trading partners (see Chart B). Over this 

period, the euro area’s current account surpluses vis-à-vis the United States and the 
United Kingdom increased by 0.7 and 0.5 percentage point of euro area GDP, while 
the euro area’s current account deficit with China narrowed by 0.2 percentage point of 
euro area GDP. Moreover, the euro area’s current account balance also improved 
vis-à-vis non-euro area EU countries (excluding the United Kingdom) and Russia,

Note: “Other EU” comprises EU Member States and EU institutions outside the euro area, excluding the United Kingdom. 

The largest changes in the geographical breakdown of the euro area current 
account balances since 2013 were recorded for trade in goods and primary 

income (see Chart B). Improvements in the bilateral current account balances mostly 
reflected increases in balances of trade in goods and primary income balances, in 
particular in the cases of the United Kingdom and the United States. At the same time, 
decreases in the current account balances were mostly due to a deterioration in 
bilateral primary income balances, 13 in particular vis-à-vis Switzerland, Japan and the 
residual group of countries. Moreover, the euro area recorded an improvement in its 
secondary income balance 14 vis-à-vis the rest of the EU (excluding the United 
Kingdom) owing to a decline in contributions to the EU budget. 

Improvements in the balance of the euro area’s bilateral trade in goods since 
2013 were largely export-driven in an environment of buoyant global demand, 
while imports also picked up overall (see Chart C). The largest increase in net 

exports was recorded vis-à-vis the United States. This was due to a strong increase in 
exports to the United States, which exceeded a modest increase in imports into the 
euro area, reflecting stronger domestic demand in the United States and the 
appreciation of the US dollar against the euro. At the same time, net exports also 
increased significantly vis-à-vis Russia as the result of a strong reduction in trade 

13  Primary income represents the return that accrues to resident institutional units on their contribution to 
the production process or for the provision of financial assets and renting natural resources to 
non-resident institutional units (e.g. compensation of employees, div idends and interest). 
14  Secondary income pertains to those current transfers between residents and non-residents that directly 
affect the level of gross national disposable income and thus influence the economy’s ability to consume 
goods and services (such as international cooperation and workers’ remittances).

values, including a significant decline in euro area imports in the light of the 
depreciation of the Russian rouble and falling commodity prices. For the other trading 
partners, changes in net exports were less significant. In particular, net exports to 
other EU countries and China changed only marginally, reflecting a relatively 
balanced, robust expansion of trade with those trading partners. The strong expansion 
of bilateral trade with other EU countries was driven by the economic recovery in the 
EU and, in particular, the resurgence of value chains since the trade collapse triggered 
by the global financial crisis. At the same time, net goods exports to the United 
Kingdom and Switzerland increased slightly, partly on account of a decline in imports 
from those countries. The euro area recorded a slight worsening of net exports 
vis-à-vis the residual group of other countries, reflecting an overall reduction in export 
and import values, the latter mostly related to the observed decline in commodity 
prices.

Developments in bilateral primary income balances since 2013 were largely 
driven by income on foreign direct investment (FDI) – which evolved rather 
heterogeneously across geographical counterparts – and income on portfolio 

debt investment (see Chart D). The euro area’s FDI income balance is largely 
shaped by the operations of multinational enterprises (MNEs) resident inside and 
outside the euro area. In particular, MNEs’ investment decisions and profitability 
determine the evolution of FDI income. The largest improvement in the euro area’s 
FDI income balance was recorded vis-à-vis the United States, followed by the United 
Kingdom. This mainly reflected a larger increase in FDI positions of euro area 
residents in the United States and the United Kingdom than in FDI positions of United 
States and United Kingdom residents in the euro area. Conversely, the euro area’s 
FDI income balance declined most significantly vis-à-vis Switzerland, Japan and the 
residual group of countries. For the first two, this is in line with a relative increase in 
Swiss and Japanese residents’ FDI positions in the euro area. In the case of the 
residual group of countries, the decline in the FDI income balance was driven by lower

destinations. The increase in the investment income balance on portfolio debt vis-à-vis 
the United Kingdom, the United States and Japan reflects the pronounced shift by 
euro area investors towards debt securities issued by entities resident in those 
countries in recent years, as well as a decline in yields on euro area debt securities. 15

Investment in intangible assets in the euro area 

Prepared by Malin Andersson and Lorena Saiz 

Investment in intangible assets enables productivity gains. Intangible assets 16 

are non‐monetary assets without physical or financial substance. They encompass a 
broad range of highly heterogeneous assets, including human capital, innovative 
products, brands, patents, software, consumer relationships, databases and 
distribution systems. Some of these assets enable firms to obtain productivity gains 
and efficiencies from new technologies and, as such, play a strategic role in a firm’s 
value creation. This box reviews the characteristics of intangibles and looks at a 
number of implications of their increasing importance. 

Investment in intangible assets has increased in importance in the euro area, 
both in absolute terms and relative to tangible assets, w ith several factors 

contributing to that development. In euro area countries and other advanced 
economies, investment in intangibles has grown strongly in recent decades. Over the 
last 20 years, growth in intellectual property products – a group of intangible assets 
included in the national accounts 17 – has outpaced growth in tangible investment in 
the euro area (see Chart A). Investment in those products has also made a significant 
contribution to annual growth in euro area non-construction investment over the last 
two decades (see Chart B). The fact that the growth rate of intangibles is higher than 
that of tangibles is being driven by factors such as the increase in global competition, 
the sectoral shift from industry to services, the expansion of the digital economy, 
changing international specialisations in the area of production, new business models 
(e.g. for tax optimisation purposes) and general technological advances. 

16 More specifically, intangibles comprise investment relating to (i) computing and computerised information 
(such as software and databases), (ii) innovative properties and company competencies (such as 
scientific and non-scientific R&D, copyrights, designs and trademarks), and (iii) economic competencies 
(including brand equity, firm-specific human capital, networks linking people and institutions together, 
organisational know-how that increases efficiency, and aspects of advertising and marketing). These are 
sometimes referred to as “intellectual assets”, “knowledge assets” or “intellectual capital”. 
In 2014 the current methodological standards for national accounts, SNA 2008 and ESA 2010, began 
regarding spending on purchased and own-account R&D as investment. As a result, intangible 
investment now includes spending on ICT equipment and intellectual property products. ESA 2010 
defines intellectual property products as knowledge derived from R&D, investigations or innovation which 
is restricted by law or other means of protection in terms of its use. Intangible assets such as human 
capital, consumer relationships and distribution systems are not covered by the national accounts.

The specific nature of intangible assets makes them less easy to use as 
collateral, which may result in suboptimal investment. Intangible assets share 

some characteristics with tangible assets. For example, both are costly to acquire, but 
help to create future profits, and entail some risk-taking. However, intangible assets 
also have a number of specific characteristics that distinguish them from tangible

assets, 18 with their scalability or non-rival nature, for instance, meaning that the 
benefits they provide to individual users are not dependent on the total number of 
users. At the same time, some intangibles have little market value and the cost of 
producing them is almost entirely a sunk cost, which makes them hard to trade, 19 
more likely to be firm-specific, and associated with particularly high risks for firms 
undertaking such investment. Finally, they are productivity-enhancing, they are often 
more efficient when combined with other assets (e.g. training which helps workers to 
use software and computers more efficiently), and they tend to generate positive 
spillovers and benefits for people other than those developing them (i.e. they are 
non-excludable). Such characteristics make them less easy to use as collateral and 
may therefore mean that they are more reliant on internal financing (i.e. savings) than 
physical capital. 20 Overall, those features could lead firms to underinvest in such 
assets. 21 

Analysis based on microdata for listed companies shows that intangible assets 
can explain part of the gap between firms’ investment in tangible assets and 

Tobin’s Q. 22 Since the financial crisis, euro area firms’ investment in tangible assets 
has been weaker than one would expect on the basis of Tobin’s Q (see Chart C, panel 
a). This may indicate either underinvestment or overvaluation in equity markets. Two 
recent publications have shown that intangible assets are able to explain some of that 
gap in the United States. 23 Regression analysis conducted for the euro area shows 
that including intangible assets that are not capitalised (i.e. not included in the balance 
sheet as assets) in both investment and Tobin’s Q 24 reduces the size of the gap 
between the two (see Chart C, panel b). The sensitivity of investment to Tobin’s Q also 
increases, albeit in all cases Tobin’s Q explains only one-third of total variation in 
investment. 

19 

18 For more details, see Haskel, J. and Westlake, S., Capitalism without Capital – The Rise of the Intangible 
Economy, Princeton University Press, 2017. See also the appendix entitled “Characteristics of 
intangibles per asset type” in European Commission, “Investment in the EU Member States: An Analysis 
of Drivers and Barriers”, European Economy Institutional Papers, No 062, October 2017. 
In some cases, the value of an intangible asset cannot be determined before it has generated value (i.e. 
there is low ex ante verifiability). 
20 See Falato, A., Kadyrzhanova, D. and Sim, J.W., “Rising intangible capital, shrinking debt capacity, and 
the US corporate savings glut”, FEDS Working Paper Series, No 2013-67, Federal Reserve System, 
2013. 
21 On the other hand, the potential to generate economies of scale that enhance market power provides 
incentives to invest in intangibles. 
22 Tobin’s Q is the ratio of the market value of a firm’s assets to their replacement value. If Tobin’s Q is 
greater than 1.0, this may suggest that the market value reflects some unmeasured or unrecorded assets 
held by the firm. High values for Tobin’s Q may encourage firms to invest more in capital assets because

Notes: Investment in tangible assets is defined as expenditure on property, plant and equipment over tangible fixed assets in the 
previous period. Tobin’s Q is defined as the firm’s market value plus total debt at book value minus cash and short-term investments over 
total assets at book value. Investment in intangible assets is defined as R&D costs plus 30% of sales, general and administrative 
expenses. In the lower panel, investment in tangible and intangible assets and Tobin’s Q both have as a denominator tangible fixed 
assets at book value plus capitalised R&D costs and 30% of sales, general and administrative expenses, using the perpetual inventory 
method and the depreciation rates that were used by Peters and Taylor 25. 

The specific nature of intangible assets poses challenges as regards the 
measurement of activity, profits and capital stock, as well as the distribution of 

productivity across firms. 26 Measurement issues relating to activity stem from the 
fact that such assets are generally regarded as firm-specific intermediate consumption 
rather than investment in firms’ balance sheets, and they remain underreported in the 
national accounts to some extent. 27 Although the percentage of intangible assets that 
are reported in firms’ annual accounts is gradually increasing, particularly in the 
service sector (see Chart D), the underreporting of intangible assets could mean that 
real output is also being underreported. Moreover, the classification of intangibles as

expenses to be deducted from earnings – as opposed to assets – is weighing on 
profits. As regards measurement of capital stock, while estimates of depreciation rates 
are associated with considerable uncertainty, the increasing share of intangible assets 
presumably implies higher overall depreciation rates. As a result, the amount of 
investment that is required to offset the consumption of capital and keep the capital 
stock at a constant level is rising. At the same time, it is possible that the capital stock 
remains underestimated owing to insufficient incorporation of intangible investment in 
the national accounts (see also the section on capital in the article on potential growth 
in the post-crisis period in this issue of the Economic Bulletin), which is particularly 
important when the contribution that capital makes to euro area potential output 
increases relative to that made by labour as labour force constraints grow. Also, a 
slowdown in intangible capital services growth could manifest itself in the data as a 
slowdown in total factor productivity growth. As regards the dispersion of productivity, 
intangible-rich firms appear to be scaling up investment dramatically, contributing to a 
widening gap between leading firms and those that are lagging behind.

Digitalisation and its impact on the economy: insights from 
a survey of large companies 

Prepared by Catherine Elding and Richard Morris 

This box summarises the findings of an ad hoc ECB survey of leading euro area 
companies looking at the impact that digitalisation has on the economy. 28 

Digitalisation may be viewed as a technology/supply shock which affects the main 
economic aggregates, notably via competition, productivity and employment effects, 
as well as through its interaction with institutions and governance. Digital technologies 
are also changing the ways in which firms do business and interact with their 
customers and suppliers. Understanding digital transformation and the channels 
through which it influences the economy is therefore increasingly relevant for the 
conduct of monetary policy. 

The main aim of the survey was to look at how digital transformation is 
affecting macroeconomic aggregates, as perceived by firms. The questionnaire 

asked companies about their take-up of digital technologies and the main obstacles to 
the adoption of such technologies. It then asked about the various channels through 
which they saw digital transformation affecting their sales, prices, productivity and 
employment, as well as the expected overall direction and magnitude of the impact 
over the next three years. Responses were received from 74 leading non-financial 
companies, split equally between producers of goods and providers of services. 
Those companies were generally very large, accounting for a combined total of 
around 3.7% of output and 1.7% of employment in the euro area. 

The take-up of digital technologies at those companies is very high, w ith big 
data and cloud computing being the most w idely adopted (see Chart A). The 

take-up of big data and cloud computing is pervasive across all sectors, as is the use 
of e-commerce, which is crucial in business-to-consumer segments. In the 
manufacturing and energy sectors, artificial intelligence, the “internet of things”, 
robotics and 3D printing are almost equally widespread, with respondents tending to 
report that the real impact comes when these technologies are combined. The main 
obstacles to the adoption of digital technologies are the difficulty of adjusting the 
organisation of the company and the need to recruit and retain highly skilled ICT staff. 
Regulation and legislation were not typically seen as a major obstacle, although some 
firms noted that, while not a hindrance, regulatory frameworks did need to evolve. 

28 This survey – the ECB Digitalisation Survey – was conducted in spring 2018.

Note: Based on responses to the following two questions: “Which digital technologies has your company adopted, including those you 
are in the process of adopting?” and “What are the main obstacles your company faced in relation to the adoption of digital 
technologies?” 

Overall, the vast majority of respondents see digitalisation as having a positive 
impact on their company’s sales (see Chart B). More than half expect the adoption 

of digital technologies to give rise to a “slight increase” in sales over the next three 
years, while around one-third expect a “significant increase”. To some extent, this 
positive view may reflect the relative size and strength of the companies surveyed, as 
their high take-up rate for digital technologies was in some cases seen as enabling 
them to gain market share.

Note: Based on responses to questions about (i) how digital technologies have affected the respondent company’s sales and (ii) the 
overall impact that the adoption of digital technologies is expected to have on sales over the next three years, with answers ranging from 
“significant decrease” (--) to “significant increase” (++). 

Better access to customers is the main channel through which digitalisation 

supports sales growth. In particular, respondents stressed the role that digital 
technologies play in providing access to customer data, which helps firms to 
understand their customers’ needs (termed “customer intimacy”) and offer new or 
improved services and tailored solutions with higher levels of quality. This, in turn, 
supports improvements in the quality of existing products (in addition to purely 
technology-driven improvements). Easier access to markets is also widely viewed as 
important. 

Respondents also see digitalisation increasing their flexibility when it comes to 

price setting (see Chart C). Around half of the respondents said that the adoption of 
digital technologies had increased their company’s ability to adjust prices in relation to 
those of their competitors, over time and/or across markets. In particular, respondents

39 

 
 
 
 
stressed the ability to “leverage more accurately peaks in demand” and thereby 
“capture the value” of the goods and services provided to customers. At the same 
time, digitalisation also makes it possible to “manage and optimise sourcing much 
better” and “get rid of waste and friction across the value chain”. While most 
companies, particularly manufacturers, tended to see digitalisation reducing costs and 
increasing margins, retailers were more likely to see input costs increasing and 
margins being squeezed.

“significant decrease” (--) to “significant increase” (++). 

The impact that digitalisation is having on prices is unclear, with downward 
pressure being observed mainly in the consumer services segment. 

Respondents were asked about the impact that the adoption of digital technologies by 
(i) their own company (“direct impact”) and (ii) other parties, i.e. suppliers, competitors

and customers (“indirect impact”), was expected to have on prices. In both cases, the 
number of respondents who expected little or no impact, or were unsure, was 
relatively high (around 50%). On balance, producers of goods tended to see their own 
adoption of digital technologies as enabling them to increase prices. 29 In contrast, 
service providers (especially retailers) were more inclined to see the adoption of digital 
technologies by others as putting downward pressure on their sales prices. 

Respondents see digitalisation increasing productivity, driven by the ease of 
sharing know ledge and more efficient production processes (see Chart D). 

Virtually all respondents regarded the easier sharing of knowledge (especially within 
the company) as being an important channel through which digitalisation raises 
productivity, with around half considering that aspect to be very important. The role 
that digitalisation plays in making the production process more efficient via automation 
is almost equally as important. Many respondents emphasised that the increase in the 
amount of data and information that they collected, both inside and outside of the 
organisation, was helping them to satisfy their customers’ needs. The overall effect on 
productivity was perceived to be overwhelmingly positive, with a stronger effect 
typically being reported in service sectors, particularly in business-to-business 
segments. 

29 However, to the extent that higher sales prices reflect greater added value, this could still be consistent 
with digitalisation putting downward pressure on producer prices for goods and services on a 
“like-for-like” basis.

On balance, respondents see digitalisation having a small negative impact on 
employment, while emphasising the importance of retraining and upskilling 

(see Chart E). Around one-third of respondents expected digitalisation to reduce 
employment in their company over the next three years, while around one-fifth 
foresaw increases in employment. Digitalisation was seen as replacing low and 
medium-skilled jobs, but not high-skilled jobs. Above all, digitalisation was regarded as 
increasing the ratio of high-skilled to low-skilled workers, with emphasis on retraining 
and the reassignment of workers to new tasks supported by digital technologies.

The role of energy prices in recent inflation outcomes: a 
cross-country perspective 

Prepared by Ieva Rubene 

Euro area headline inflation is currently dominated by a strong contribution 

from energy prices. In the third quarter of 2018, energy prices contributed 0.9 
percentage point to the headline HICP inflation rate of around 2.0%, thus accounting 
for almost half. This large contribution mainly reflects past developments in crude oil 
prices, a factor that constitutes a common influence across euro area countries. 
However, the contribution of energy to HICP inflation depends both on the share of 
energy in consumption expenditure and on the degree of pass-through of oil price 
developments to consumer energy prices. This box reviews the extent to which these 
features can help explain differences across euro area countries in the recent 
contribution of energy to overall HICP inflation. 30 

The contribution of energy to HICP inflation currently differs significantly 

across euro area countries. For most large countries, in the third quarter of 2018 the 
share of HICP inflation accounted for by the energy contribution was fairly close to the 
euro area average, i.e. up to half (see Chart A). However, for some smaller countries, 
this share ranged from very small (energy accounting for almost nothing in Malta) to 
very high (energy accounting for almost all of HICP inflation in Ireland). It should be 
noted that this cross-country comparison is only indicative of the relative importance of 
energy, as headline HICP is also determined by developments in HICP inflation 
excluding energy. 31 

30  This box does not cover the impact of tax changes on energy inflation and the indirect first-round effects 
of oil price changes. For a description of latter, see Task Force of the Monetary Policy Committee of the 
European System of Central Banks, “Energy markets and the euro area macroeconomy”, Occasional 
Paper Series, No 113, ECB, June 2010, in particular the section entitled “The impact of energy prices on 
inflation”. On the impact of oil prices on euro area consumer energy prices, see also the box entitled “Oil 
prices and euro area consumer energy prices”, Economic Bulletin, Issue 2, ECB, 2016. 
31  Relative contributions can also be distorted if HICP excluding energy and/or energy inflation rates are 
negative.

Note: “Other energy” includes liquid and solid fuels and heat energy. 

The weight of energy in the HICP differs across countries, but cannot fully 
explain current differences in contributions to headline inflation. Current 

contributions of energy prices to headline inflation are generally above what would be 
implied by the energy weight in the HICP. These weights range from around 6% in 
Malta to almost 15% in Slovakia, while for the euro area as a whole the weight of 
energy in HICP is 10% (see Chart B). On balance, transport fuels account for roughly 
half of the energy weight (more than any other energy item), and fuel prices typically 
follow changes in crude oil prices in euro more closely than other energy components. 
This explains why, in all countries, fuel prices have historically been the main 
determinant of energy inflation dynamics. 32 At the same time, the differences in fuel 
price inflation across countries in the third quarter of 2018 were larger than can be 
accounted for by the differences in weights. This suggests that other factors are also at 
work in determining the pass-through. 

32  Over the period since 1999, the average (unweighted) contemporaneous correlation across euro area 
countries between annual rates of change in total energy and fuel prices has been 0.9, while for gas 
prices (at 0.5) and electricity prices (at 0.1) it has been significantly smaller.

Note: “Other energy” includes liquid and solid fuels and heat energy. The relatively large weight of transport fuels in Luxembourg also 
reflects purchases by consumers who are not resident in Luxembourg. 

The pass-through of oil prices to fuel prices is not one-to-one, as the final 
consumer price also depends on taxes and the behaviour of margins. Changes 

in taxes (in particular excise taxes) usually have a noticeable impact on fuel prices, 33 
and the level of taxes affects the pass-through of oil price changes. The larger the 
share of excise taxes – a fixed amount per litre – is in a country’s fuel price, the smaller 
the percentage change in fuel prices is for a given change in oil prices. By contrast, 
although differences in rates of value added tax (VAT) can partly explain differences in 
the level of the consumer price of fuel, owing to the proportional nature of VAT, 
different VAT rates across countries cannot explain differences in the pass-through of 
changes in oil prices to fuel prices. In the case of petrol prices, the total tax share 
varies across countries from around 50% in Luxembourg, Malta and Spain to just 
above 60% in the Netherlands, Italy and Greece, thus partly helping to explain 
differences in the final level of the fuel price and the pass-through of crude oil price 
changes to fuel prices (see Chart C). Costs and margins arising in the refining and 
distribution processes usually constitute a relatively small part of fuel prices (just 
above 10%). Over longer horizons it is unlikely that, for instance due to differences in 
technology or buffering practices, such costs and margins could account for major 
differences across countries in the pass-through of crude oil prices to fuel prices. 
However, over shorter horizons, for instance if margins were to react to seasonal 
boosts in demand, such differences might become relevant. 

33  For example, increases in excise taxes contributed to higher annual fuel price inflation in Estonia and 
Latvia in the third quarter of 2018. Changes in excise taxes in France and Finland had smaller impacts.

Gas and electricity inflation does not necessarily co-move w ith oil prices and 

fuel inflation. While the pass-through of crude oil prices to fuel prices is relatively 
straightforward and fast (almost complete within five weeks), 34 the pass-through to 
consumer gas and electricity prices is more complex and more limited. Consumer gas 
prices are driven largely by wholesale gas prices, which over time have become less 
strongly linked to oil prices. 35 Electricity is generated in many different ways (hydro, 
solar, wind, nuclear, coal, etc.) and the frequency of price changes for electricity is 
different from that for fuel and gas. In all euro area countries, the link between oil 
prices and gas and electricity prices is more delayed and weaker than the link between 
oil prices and fuel prices, and the strength of the link also varies more across countries 
for gas and electricity than it does for fuel (see Chart D). 36 Moreover, in a number of 
euro area countries, gas and electricity prices (as well as heat energy) are fully or 
partly regulated, so they may respond to oil price changes with a delay or they may not 
respond at all. 37 Owing to this weaker link between gas and electricity prices and 
crude oil prices, euro area countries with a higher share of fuel in their energy basket 
have generally also had a higher contribution of energy to their inflation outcomes in 
recent months. 

34  See Task Force of the Monetary Policy Committee of the European System of Central Banks, “Energy 
markets and the euro area macroeconomy”, Occasional Paper Series, No 113, ECB, June 2010, in 
particular the section entitled “The impact of energy prices on inflation”.. 
35  Owing to developments in spot markets in Europe, the share of oil-linked wholesale gas pricing declined 
from around 80% in 2005 to around 30% in 2017. See International Gas Union, “Wholesale Gas Price 
Survey”, 2018 Edition, June 2018. 
36  Given the delay in the pass-through for gas and electricity prices, the correlation coefficient for longer 
lags (unweighted average across euro area countries; calculated using annual inflation rates) would 
reach 0.6 between crude oil and gas prices and 0.3 between crude oil and electricity prices, which is 
below the contemporaneous correlation coefficient of 0.8 between crude oil and fuel prices. 
37  According to Eurostat’s classification, the following countries have partly or fully regulated prices for 
either electricity, gas or heat energy: Estonia, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, 
Malta, the Netherlands, Slovenia, Slovakia and Finland.

Notes: Finland does not have gas in its consumer price basket. The pass-through of crude oil price changes to gas and electricity prices 
could take one to two years (the correlation coefficient for longer lags is higher), which is very slow compared to the rather fast 
pass-through to fuel prices (up to 90% within five weeks). However, even accounting for this delay, the correlation coefficient calculated 
for longer lags with crude oil prices is lower for gas and electricity prices than for fuel prices. 

To conclude, all euro area countries have faced a rise in the oil price in euro, but 
this has affected their HICP inflation rates to different extents. This reflects 

differences in both the respective weights of energy items (fuel, gas and electricity) in 
the HICP and the strength of the link between the prices of the different energy items 
and oil prices. Hence, strong common oil price developments do not necessarily lead 
to a reduction in inflation dispersion. Looking forward, the small downward trend in 
crude oil futures prices implies that energy price inflation should moderate somewhat, 
reducing both its contribution to headline HICP inflation and cross-country differences 
in headline inflation due to energy outcomes.

Potential output in the post-crisis period 

Prepared by Malin Andersson, Bela Szörfi, Máté Tóth and Nico Zorell 

Potential output is typically seen by economic analysts as the highest level of 
economic activity that can be sustained over the long term. Changes in potential 
output can be driven by factors such as labour supply, capital investment and 
technological innovation. Recent estimates by international institutions suggest that 
the euro area economy is currently operating close to its potential. The ongoing 
economic expansion appears to have largely absorbed the spare capacity created by 
the global financial crisis and the sovereign debt crisis. At the same time, the 
estimated rate of potential output growth also appears to have recovered most of its 
pre-crisis momentum, underpinned mainly by an expansion of the labour force, a 
decline in trend unemployment and stronger productivity gains. Looking ahead, 
projections by international institutions suggest that actual euro area GDP growth will 
continue to outpace potential growth in the near term. Hence, supply constraints are 
likely to become increasingly binding going forward, which would be conducive to a 
gradual strengthening of euro area inflation.

Introduction 

Potential output is a key economic concept as its evolution determines how 
fast an economy can grow in a sustainable way. It is typically thought of as the 

highest level of economic activity that can be sustained by means of the available 
technology and factors of production, in particular labour and capital, without creating 
inflationary pressure. Institutions that facilitate and encourage innovation, factor 
accumulation and an efficient allocation of resources are particularly conducive to 
faster growth in potential output. Therefore, sound structural policies play a key role in 
promoting sustainable growth. 

For central banks, potential output estimates can support the analysis of the 
state of the business cycle and the implications for the dynamics of wages and 

prices. If economic activity exceeds the level of potential output, the increased factor 
utilisation will typically put upward pressure on factor costs and ultimately on 
consumer prices. Similarly, such price pressures tend to recede if economic activity 
falls below the level of potential output. The output gap, defined as the percentage 
deviation of the actual level of output (i.e. real GDP) from the potential level, is 
therefore often regarded as an indicator of the state of the business cycle and possible 
inflationary pressures. Potential output estimates also provide a basis for adjusting 
government budget balances for the effects of the business cycle and are included in 
analyses of the long-term sustainability of public debt. Moreover, they are also used to 
gauge the impact of structural reforms.

As potential output is unobservable, it can only be estimated w ith uncertainty. 

There are various methods for estimating potential output on the basis of observed 
data. However, regardless of the method used, such estimates are subject to 
considerable uncertainty and often revised heavily over time. Therefore, they need to 
be treated with caution. 

Against this backdrop, this article sheds some light on developments in euro 
area potential output in the post-crisis period. Section 2 discusses the concept of 

potential output and its measurement. Section 3 examines recent developments in 
potential output, while Sections 4 and 5 take a closer look at the main driving factors. 
Section 6 presents the main policy conclusions.

The concept of potential output and its measurement 

2.1 

Definition and determinants 

Potential output is typically defined as the highest level of economic activity 
that can be sustained by means of the available technology and factors of 
production w ithout creating inflationary pressure. 38 Attempts to exceed this level 

of production will lead to rising levels of factor utilisation, thereby putting upward 
pressure on factor costs and ultimately on consumer price inflation. Starting from a 
neutral position in the economic cycle, a sustainable, non-inflationary increase in 
output needs to be underpinned by an expansion of potential output. 

It is important to distinguish between the level and the rate of growth of 

potential output. If the level of potential output exceeds actual output, a negative 
output gap emerges. In such circumstances, the closing of a negative output gap 
would require actual growth to exceed potential growth for a period of time. 

Potential output is usually thought to be determined by supply-side factors, 
highlighting the importance of sound structural policies for sustainable 

long-term growth. The supply-side determinants include the state of technology and 
the available factors of production, most notably labour and capital. At a more 
fundamental level, the long-term capacity of an economy to produce is shaped by its 
institutional framework, including the structure of property rights, regulations and the 
judicial and educational systems. Economies with institutions that facilitate and 
encourage innovation, factor accumulation and an efficient allocation of resources can 
be expected to record faster growth in the long run. 39 Indeed, according to 

38  Alternative concepts whereby potential output is defined as the level of output that could be obtained in 
the absence of price-setting frictions or market inefficiencies (such as imperfect competition) also appear 
in the literature. However, the corresponding potential output series are highly dependent on the 
underlying model and the frictions assumed therein. See Vetlov, I., Hlédik, T., Jonsson, M., Kucsera, H. 
and Pisani, M., “Potential output in DSGE models”, Working Paper Series, No 1351, ECB, June 2011. 
39  See Acemoglu, D., Johnson, S. and Robinson, J., “Institutions as a Fundamental Cause of Long-Run 
Growth”, in Aghion, P. and Durlauf, S. (eds.), Handbook of Economic Growth, Vol. 1, Part A, Elsevier, 
2005, pp. 385-472.

Eurosystem estimates, the implementation of best institutional practices in euro area 
countries could significantly boost their potential growth rates. 40 

The global financial crisis has led to suggestions that demand-side factors 
might also have very persistent or even permanent impacts on output. 41 

According to the “hysteresis” hypothesis, demand shortfalls can perpetuate 
themselves by adversely affecting the supply potential of the economy and thereby 
lowering the level of potential output or even its longer-term growth rate. For instance, 
a demand-led recession may discourage workers from searching for jobs or lead to 
the erosion of their skills. Firms may refrain from undertaking investment decisions or 
cut their innovation budgets, which would lower the level of production that can be 
sustained without stoking (dis-)inflationary pressure. According to this view, 
countercyclical policies could reduce the risks of hysteresis in times of crisis or reverse 
its effects ex post, with lasting positive impacts on output. 42 Whether the hysteresis 
hypothesis is valid is ultimately an empirical question and may also vary across 
economies and over time. 

2.2 

Measurement 

Since potential output cannot be observed directly, it has to be estimated. 

Simple statistical methodologies (“univariate filters”) – such as the Hodrick-Prescott 
(HP) filter – derive potential output by smoothing out fluctuations in actual output. They 
mechanically split the observed output series into a trend component and a cyclical 
component. More sophisticated statistical approaches (“multivariate filters”) also use 
information from other economic indicators, such as inflation, to disentangle the trend 
from the cycle. Another common approach, which is employed by the European 
Commission and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development 
(OECD), is based on a macroeconomic production function, i.e. a simple model of the 
supply side of the economy relating potential output to the trend components of 
productivity and the available factor inputs (usually labour and capital). 43 Hybrid 
methods combine useful elements from both the statistical approach and the 
production function approach (see Box 1). Other approaches are based on more 
complex structural economic models. 44 Importantly, all these methods for measuring 
potential output have their limitations. Therefore, the analysis below will draw on a 
broad range of estimates based on alternative methodologies. 

Regardless of the method used, estimates of potential output are subject to 

considerable uncertainty. The choice of a specific statistical or economic model

always implies judgement and introduces uncertainty. Since models are simplifications 
of reality, not all information that is possibly relevant for estimating potential output can 
be processed. In addition, owing to the typically stochastic nature of these models, a 
degree of uncertainty inherently stems from the characteristics of their shocks. The 
uncertainty also relates to the parameters of such models which can only be estimated 
with imprecision. Moreover, the data – both historical and projected – which are used 
to estimate the models are subject to revisions. Such modifications can result in 
significant revisions to the estimated path of potential output. Overall, owing to these 
different types of uncertainty, any point estimate of the output gap has to be treated 
with a significant degree of caution. 

Box 1 

An unobserved components model for euro area potential output 

Prepared by Máté Tóth 

The unobserved components model (UCM-PF) introduced in this box combines a multivariate 
filter approach w ith a Cobb-Douglas production function (PF) relating potential output to 
labour, capital and total factor productivity (TFP). This combination incorporates more economic 

structure than the traditional production function approach, in which production inputs are typically 
filtered individually with the help of univariate filters. A possible shortcoming of the latter approach is 
that the resulting potential output path may closely resemble a potential output path extracted with a 
univariate filter applied to the output series itself, thus providing little added value. The UCM-PF 
approach addresses this issue by estimating the trends of the relevant production inputs jointly in a 
system of equations in which the trend-cycle decomposition is subject to certain key, albeit 
reduced-form, economic relationships (see Figure A).

The underlying model is a backward-looking state-space model that employs the Kalman 
filter to decompose four key observable variables (real GDP, the unemployment rate, a 
measure of core inflation and wage inflation) into trend and cyclical components. For this 

purpose, it relies on several economic relationships, including a Cobb-Douglas production function, a 
wage and a price Phillips curve and an Okun’s law relationship. A number of additional variables enter 
the model as exogenously determined observables (e.g. the capital stock and the working age 
population), while others (such as the labour force participation rate and average hours worked) are 
endogenously decomposed into cyclical and trend components, with the latter serving as input into 
the embedded production function. In the model, a closed output gap is consistent with the absence 
of excessive price or wage pressures, namely inflation being on its long-run trend and wage inflation 
being consistent with trend inflation and trend productivity growth. In the following sections, 
model-based uncertainty bands generated by the UCM-PF will be used to highlight the uncertainty 
surrounding point estimates of the output gap, potential growth and the trend unemployment rate (or 
non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment – NAIRU).

Recent developments in potential output 

This section analyses recent developments in potential output in the euro area. 

It focuses on the post-crisis period (2014-18), but also briefly revisits the crisis years 
(2008-13) and the pre-crisis period (1999-2007). 45 The analysis is based on a broad 
range of estimates by the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund 
(IMF) and the OECD, along with estimates based on the model presented in Box 1. 

Potential growth in the euro area is estimated to have increased over recent 
years, although it is still weaker than before the global financial crisis. Prior to 

the crisis, potential growth was judged to be on a secular downward trend (see 
Chart 1). Between 1999 and 2007, the estimated rate of potential growth gradually 
declined from around 2.3% to around 1.7%. The outbreak of the global financial crisis 
seems to have led to a further decline in potential growth to below 1.0%. However, 
available estimates indicate that potential output recovered in the post-crisis period, 
reaching growth rates close to 1.5%. Hence, the latest estimates for euro area 
potential growth are well above those for the crisis years, albeit still below those for the 
pre-crisis period. All these estimates are subject to considerable uncertainty, as 
indicated by the shaded bands in Chart 1. At the same time, they all point to an 
inverted J-shaped path for euro area potential growth in the period between 1999 and 
2017. Moreover, estimates of the euro area aggregate mask significant heterogeneity 
across individual euro area countries. 

The level of euro area potential output remains well below the path implied by 

the pre-crisis trends. This can be illustrated with a simple linear projection in which it 
is assumed that from 2007 onwards potential output steadily increased at the pace 
recorded in that year. The European Commission’s latest estimate of potential output 

45  For the crisis period, see Anderton et al., “Potential output from a euro area perspective”, Occasional 
Paper Series, No 156, ECB, November 2014, and the articles entitled “Potential output, economic slack 
and the link to nominal developments since the start of the crisis”, Monthly Bulletin, ECB, 
November 2013, and “Trends in potential output”, Monthly Bulletin, ECB, January 2011.

in 2017 is around 10% below the level implied by the linear projection (see Chart 2). 
However, caution is warranted when using such gaps as a proxy for the impact of the 
crisis. Real-time estimates of potential output are often subject to substantial 
revisions, especially in times of crisis. In fact, the potential output estimates for the 
euro area were widely revised downwards following the onset of the global financial 
crisis, before these revisions went into reverse more recently.

output – i.e. real GDP – declined precipitously. At the same time, potential output

apparently continued to increase, albeit at a slower pace than before the crisis. As a 
result, a negative output gap opened up, signalling slack in the euro area economy 
(see Chart 3). 46 During the economic recovery, GDP growth consistently exceeded 
available estimates of potential growth. Consequently, the negative output gap 
gradually declined and now seems to be close to zero. Supply constraints are likely to 
become increasingly binding going forward, which would be conducive to a gradual 
strengthening of wage growth and underlying inflation.

The similarity in estimates by international institutions understates the 
uncertainty surrounding the current output gap in the euro area. In particular, it 

has been argued that economic slack might still be larger than indicated by the 
consensus view of international institutions. This argument is often based on the 
observation that the underlying potential growth estimates and their revisions tend to 
co-move with economic activity. 47 This procyclicality could partly be a statistical 
artefact due to methodological issues, such as the well-known end-point problem of 
filtering procedures. There may therefore be reason to believe that the degree of 
economic slack in the euro area over recent years has been larger than indicated by 
the estimates of international institutions. 48 This could also help explain the relatively 
muted dynamics of underlying inflation over this period. However, the procyclicality of 
potential growth and output gap estimates may also stem from hysteresis, the 
downward rigidity of prices and wages, and other effects that pull down potential 
growth during economic downturns and gradually wane during upturns (see 
Section 2.1).

Dissecting recent developments in potential output 

In an accounting sense, potential output is determined by the trend 
components of the factors of production – capital and labour – and total factor 

productivity (TFP). A macroeconomic production function can be used to decompose 
potential growth into the contributions from labour, capital and TFP (see Section 2.2). 
TFP captures the overall efficiency of the use of the factors of production and its 
evolution is therefore often seen as a rough indication of technological progress. In 
practice, TFP is not directly observable and is typically calculated as a residual term in 
a growth accounting exercise. Thus it cannot be considered a pure measure of 
productivity. 

Both the decline in potential growth during the crisis and its subsequent 
recovery were largely driven by the contributions of capital and labour. Both 

contributions declined during the crisis, before recovering in the post-crisis period (see 
Chart 4). The latest estimates for 2017 indicate that the contributions of labour and 
TFP to potential growth are broadly in line with those in 2007. However, the 
contribution of capital is still weaker than before the crisis, explaining why potential 
growth has not yet fully recovered. The downward trend in potential growth in the 
pre-crisis period mainly reflected a secular decline in TFP growth. 49

While the inverted J-shaped path of potential growth found in the euro area has 
also been observed in other major advanced economies, there are notable 
cross-country differences in the underlying driving forces. Box 2 illustrates this 

for the United States and Japan. Moreover, from a long-term perspective, potential 
growth in the euro area has fallen short of that in other major advanced economies, in 
particular the United States.

Similarly to developments in the euro area, estimated potential output in the United States 
and Japan has recovered since 2013 along w ith economic activity. At the same time, the current 

pace of potential growth in the US economy remains well below the growth rates recorded prior to the 
global financial crisis, while it is broadly comparable to pre-crisis rates in the case of Japan. According 
to a broad range of estimates, including from national sources and international institutions, potential 
growth is currently estimated at close to 2% in the United States and around 1% in Japan (see 
Chart A).

An increasing stock of capital, reflecting strengthening investment activity in this period, was 
a key contributory factor in the recovery in potential output in both countries. While investment 

activity plummeted in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, the ensuing demand recovery – 
supported by economic policies – helped stimulate investment spending amid gradually declining 
spare capacities (see Chart B). 

By contrast, the contribution of the labour component to potential growth in the United States 
and Japan differed, ow ing to secular trends observed in these two countries. In the United 

States, the labour contribution has remained positive and broadly unchanged since the global 
financial crisis, as slower growth in the potential labour force was counteracted by a gradual decline in 
the trend unemployment rate. The latter could reflect the gradual waning of hysteresis effects and 
also shifts in the composition of the workforce, which in turn may reflect, for example, the fact that 
older and more educated workers tend to have lower unemployment rates. In Japan, the contribution 
of labour to potential growth turned positive in 2013, following a prolonged period of strong negative 
readings. Demographic developments, leading to a shrinking workforce, are the main factor that led 
to labour having acted as a drag on potential output. Recent measures taken by the Japanese 
government to encourage the participation of women in the labour market, the increasing willingness 
of retired workers to remain active amid rising longevity, and more flexible working contracts offered 
by Japanese firms have all helped to increase labour force participation in the Japanese economy,

Notes: For the United States, “potential growth” refers to the non-farm business sector and “labour” refers to the contribution of hours worked, while “capital” 
refers to the contribution of capital services. For Japan, “labour” refers to the sum of contributions of the number of people employed and hours worked. 

TFP growth contributed positively to potential output in both countries, although it has 

shown diverging patterns over the recent past. In the United States, the contribution from TFP 
growth has remained broadly stable during the post-crisis period. In Japan, the estimated positive 
contribution of TFP growth has roughly halved over the same period, which can be attributed to an 
ageing capital stock and delays in the introduction of new technologies. 50 However, the increasing 
implementation of technological advances, especially in sectors currently facing acute labour 
shortages, could strengthen underlying productivity growth over the longer term. 51 

Looking ahead, demographic developments present both countries w ith a challenge that 
needs to be resolved to avoid weakening their potential growth. In Japan, progress in 

implementing the government’s growth strategy, including regulatory and institutional reforms, further 
increases in labour force participation, and continued efforts by firms to increase productivity are 
expected to tackle this and contribute to gradually accelerating potential growth over the next few 
years. 52 In the United States, the recent changes in income taxes could encourage more people to 
enter the labour force, thereby limiting the negative impact on potential growth stemming from 
population ageing. 53 Also, the reduction in corporate income tax could boost investment and thereby 
contribute to higher potential output, whereas recent policies aimed at reducing immigration could 
have an opposite effect by further weakening the growth of the labour force.

A closer look at the factors driving potential output 

This section takes a closer look at some of the underlying factors driving recent 
developments in potential output in the euro area. In particular, it seeks to answer 

the question of why the contributions of labour and TFP to potential growth have 
broadly returned to their pre-crisis levels, while the capital contribution remains 
subdued. The section concludes by looking at the longer-term outlook for potential 
growth. 

5.1 

Labour 

The contribution of labour to potential growth can be traced back to trends in 
the labour force, the unemployment rate and hours worked per employee. The 

labour force includes all those in work or seeking work. Changes in the labour force, in 
turn, can be decomposed into changes in the working age population (15-74 years of 
age) and the labour force participation rate (i.e. the percentage of the working age 
population participating in the labour force). 

The enlargement of the working age population on account of immigration has 
supported potential growth over recent years. Following a contraction between 

2009 and 2015, the working age population has been increasing over recent years. 
These developments reflect two countervailing forces (see Chart 5). On the one hand, 
“natural” population growth has been negative for some time now, since the 
“baby-boomer” generation is reaching retirement age and fertility rates are low. On the 
other hand, there has been a net inflow of people of working age, in particular from 
other EU Member States. 54 

54  It should be noted that the decomposition of changes in the working age population by citizenship is only 
an imperfect proxy of migration flows.

Notes: “Euro area citizens” refers to all members of the working age population aged 15 to 74 holding citizenship of an EU Member State 
whose currency is the euro. The data have been adjusted for structural breaks, in particular for Germany (first quarter of 2010) and 
France (first quarter of 2014). The chart is based on four-quarter averages. 

Labour force participation has continued to increase during the recovery, 
underpinned by increased participation of the older generations and women. 55 

While the euro area labour force is ageing, more people are remaining economically 
active later in life. In line with this longer-term trend, the participation rate of those 
aged 55 to 74 has continued to increase during the recovery. This reflects increases in 
the pension age in many euro area countries, as well as other factors, most notably 
rising education levels. In addition, the labour force participation of women has 
continued to increase, which is also partly due to rising education levels. 56 All these 
structural changes have contributed to a steady increase in the participation rate over 
recent years (see Chart 6). Coupled with a growing working age population, this trend 
has led to an expansion of the labour force during the ongoing economic recovery. 
However, the rate of growth of the labour force still remains below that recorded in the 
pre-crisis period.

Notes: The total participation rate is defined as the labour force as a percentage of the working age population. The latter comprises 
those aged between 15 and 74. The participation rates for individual groups (i.e. women, men and older people) only relate to the 
relevant parts of the labour force and the population. 

A decline in the trend unemployment rate is estimated to be another important 
driver of the post-crisis recovery in potential growth. The trend unemployment 

rate broadly corresponds to the unemployment rate that is consistent with 
non-accelerating wage (or price) inflation. 57 Available estimates overall suggest that 
the trend unemployment rate in the euro area increased in the crisis period, partly due 
to hysteresis effects, before declining to around 8.0-9.5% more recently (see Chart 7). 
To some extent, these developments reflect transitory factors. Since wages tend to 
adjust slowly to shocks, the macroeconomic adjustment partly operates through 
persistent changes in the unemployment rate. However, the post-crisis decline in the 
estimated trend unemployment rate is also likely to be driven by structural factors, 
most notably the labour market reforms undertaken in some euro area countries. 

57  An alternative concept is the “structural unemployment rate”, which is affected only by structural factors, 
such as institutions and technology – see Hav ik et al., “The Production Function Methodology for 
Calculating Potential Growth Rates & Output Gaps”, European Economy – Economic Papers, No 535, 
European Commission, November 2014, Box 1.

Hours worked per employee have continued to decline over recent years, 
although there are some signs of stabilisation. 58 The longer-term downward trend 

in average hours worked per employee mainly reflects secular changes in the 
composition of euro area employment. Most importantly, the shares of part-time 
workers and the services sector (where hours worked are typically lower than in other 
sectors) in overall employment have increased over the past decade. 

5.2 

Capital 

The capital stock is another essential determinant of potential output, but data 

are not easy to obtain. The gross capital stock is the physical capital available in the 
private and public sectors of the economy for production processes. 59 The true 
potential capital stock is not directly measurable but can be calculated using the 
“perpetual inventory” method. The current net capital stock is then derived from the 
past capital stock, subtracting depreciation and adding new investment. Such capital 
stock data come with a long publication lag. 60 The real capital stock also depends on 
price trends of capital goods. These trends could be very different from those of 
intermediate and consumer goods. Over the past two decades, the investment 
deflator – and in particular the quality-adjusted prices of information and

2008”, Economic Bulletin, Issue 6, ECB, 2016.

60  Official capital stock data (based on non-financial asset balance sheets) that are in line with the 
ESA 2010 Transmission Programme are available for the total economy and by asset (at annual 
frequency) for most EU countries, but not for the euro area as a whole, with a publication lag of about 
24 months.

communications technology (ICT) goods – has been less dynamic than the overall 
value added deflator, which has supported the capital-output ratio in real terms. 61 

The rising share of intangible investment increases capital consumption and 
poses challenges to measuring the capital stock. The capital stock in the 

construction sector generally depreciates very slowly, while the business sector capital 
stock, particularly intangibles, depreciates much faster. 62 Aggregate depreciation 
rates are likely to increase gradually as countries’ income levels rise, assuming that 
the share of assets with shorter lifespans (such as intangible assets) grows in 
economically more advanced countries. As a result, the amount of investment 
required to offset the consumption of capital and to maintain the capital stock at a 
constant level increases. At the same time, it is possible that the size of the capital 
stock remains underestimated owing to insufficient incorporation of intangible 
investment 63 in the national accounts (see also the box entitled “Investment in 
intangibles in the euro area” in this issue of the Economic Bulletin). 64 Intangible 
investment has long been considered largely as intermediate consumption – as 
opposed to investment – on the balance sheets of firms, reflecting the fact that such 
investment was thought to exclusively benefit firms themselves. Available estimates 
suggest that GDP (and gross saving and investment rates) in Europe would be 5 to 
10 percentage points higher if all intangibles were classified as investment. 65 

The cyclical recovery in overall investment since the crisis has given some 
positive impetus to the capital stock in the euro area, although its contribution 
to the capital stock has been lower than in the pre-crisis period. Increasing 

demand, low financing costs and better access to finance as a result of the ECB’s 
accommodative monetary policy have supported the recovery in investment. 66 As a 
result, capital stock growth rates have accelerated in the euro area in the period since 
the crisis (see Chart 8). However, lower than pre-crisis growth rates of investment 67 
have weighed on capital stock contributions to potential growth in the recovery period 
(see Chart 4). There are a number of factors behind the lower growth rates. First, it 
took time to unwind excess capacity accumulated during the crisis in the construction 
sector – particularly in housing, but also in commercial and industrial construction – 
which resulted in underutilised capital and excess capacity. Second, recent years have 
still been characterised by persistently high uncertainty, slowing growth expectations 
related partly to population ageing, and remaining deleveraging needs, both in the

research and development, and around 30% for software, according to data from the EU KLEMS 
database. 
63  See Haskel, J. and Westlake, S., Capitalism without Capital: The Rise of the Intangible Economy, 
Princeton University Press, 2017. 
64  However, since its revision in 2014, the European System of Accounts (ESA 2010) has distinguished 
between construction investment (about 50% of euro area total investment), machinery and equipment 
(about 30%) and investment in intellectual property products (about 20%).

scrapping rate might have been higher due to crisis-related company liquidations. 
Also, in this period public investment was subdued owing to fiscal constraints in some 
countries. Public investment has been shown to have considerable spillover effects on 
private investment. 68

5.3 

Total factor productivity 

In the decade leading up to the global financial crisis, TFP growth was on a 
downward trend in the euro area and in other advanced economies. 

Between 1999 and 2007, trend TFP growth gradually slowed from 1.0% to 0.5%, 
according to European Commission estimates (see Chart 9). Several explanations 
have been proposed for this deceleration, some of which are complementary. 69 
Mismeasurement problems, for instance with regard to intangible investments, may 
have led to an underestimation of TFP growth. More fundamentally, recent innovations 
might have been less pervasive than earlier technological advances, such as the 
railways and electricity. Moreover, there is evidence that it takes longer for 
technological innovations by pioneering firms to be incorporated into the production 
processes of other firms.

Note: The trend is based on estimates by the European Commission. 

The global financial crisis exacerbated the decline in TFP growth. In fact, TFP 

growth is even estimated to have turned negative during the crisis, albeit largely driven 
by its cyclical component. Firm-level evidence indicates that bank forbearance and 
inadequate insolvency regimes locked capital into firms with low levels of productivity, 
weakening the cleansing effects typically associated with recessions. 70 Following the 
unwinding of macroeconomic imbalances in euro area countries, structural rigidities 
may have hampered the necessary reallocation of resources towards more productive 
sectors and firms. Moreover, protracted private sector balance sheet repair has 
weakened investment, thereby potentially limiting technological innovation. 

TFP growth has increased during the ongoing economic recovery, broadly 

returning to its pre-crisis rates. The adverse effects of the crisis on TFP growth, for 
instance through disruptions in financial intermediation, cuts in research and 
development budgets and subdued spending on public infrastructure, have started to 
wane. There is also evidence that the crisis has ultimately led to a reallocation of 
resources towards more productive firms (e.g. through the elimination of unviable 
businesses). Moreover, it may simply take some time for innovations in the field of 
digitalisation to be widely adopted throughout the economy. Sustained improvements 
in educational attainment also continue to support TFP growth. 

5.4 

Longer-term outlook 

Euro area potential growth w ill remain broadly stable over the coming years, 
according to the projections by international institutions. On average, the 

European Commission, the IMF and the OECD envisage potential growth of 1.4% in

While the longer-term outlook for potential growth is more uncertain, 
population ageing looks set to exert increasing downward pressure. 71 

According to projections by Eurostat, the euro area’s old-age dependency ratio 
(i.e. the number of people aged 65 or over as a percentage of the working age 
population) will increase from around 30% at present to around 50% by 2050 and the 
working age population will decline by around 23 million over the same period (see 
Chart 10). This forecast already takes into account net immigration of around 
800,000 persons per year. The expected decline in the working age population could 
be partly offset by further increases in the overall participation rate on the back of 
previous pension reforms and rising education levels. However, on the basis of these 
projections, the euro area labour force looks set to decline over the coming decades, 
exerting downward pressure on potential growth.

Bulletin, Issue 2, ECB, 2018.

The impact of population ageing on potential growth could be partly offset by 

other factors. In particular, automation and digitalisation could support TFP growth 
(see Box 3). However, when and to what extent this will happen is highly uncertain. 

With regard to the capital stock, it could be expected to continue grow ing and 
to contribute positively to potential growth. International institutions also expect 

capital stock growth to accelerate further in the next few years. The reasons for 
continued capital accumulation include sustained cyclical demand, near-full capacity 
utilisation in the capital goods-producing sector and a continued need to replace and 
upgrade capital in order to face the challenges posed by globalisation and the digital 
economy. In the longer term, expectations of further advances in technology – and the 
resulting changing composition of the capital stock – point to an accelerating need for 
capital accumulation to keep up with rising overall depreciation rates. Recent research 
has also found that the capital stock of intangible assets adjusts more slowly to 
fluctuations in the economy than tangible investment, 72 given the irreversible nature of 
intangible investment. This could result in a capital stock that is becoming less 
sensitive to the business cycle. 

Box 3 

The role of digitalisation in shaping developments in potential output and the output gap in 
the euro area 

Prepared by Vincent Labhard 

Digitalisation may be viewed as a supply shock affecting key macroeconomic aggregates for 
the euro area, including potential output and the output gap, largely via possible competition,

productivity and employment effects. 73 One aspect of this is the digitalisation of production and 
supply chains, involving automation, robotisation and artificial intelligence. This tends to change 
relative prices and the allocation of work across factors of production, for instance between labour 
and capital or between routine and non-routine jobs, and thereby affect productivity. Another aspect 
of digitalisation is digital and mobile communication and connectivity, encompassing the internet, 
social media, cloud computing and big data analysis. These have an impact on competition by 
altering relative prices and market shares between, for instance, digital and non-digital firms or small 
and large firms (the “winner takes all” phenomenon). The third aspect of digitalisation is new goods 
and services, both information technology (IT)-related and non-IT-related, which may lead to changes 
in prices and/or consumer preferences. 

While some aspects of digitalisation are more advanced than others, it seems to be 
progressing relatively steadily for the EU as a whole. This can be seen, for example, from the 

European Commission’s Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI), as displayed in Chart A for the 
EU for the sample between 2014 and 2018. It is important to note, however, that many of the major 
milestones of digitalisation occurred before the sample covered in Chart A, such as early research on 
artificial intelligence in the 1950s, the first computer networks in the 1960s, the first email in the 
1970s, the first driverless car in the 1980s, the world-wide web, the internet of things and search 
engines in the 1990s, and social media in the 2000s. As a result, digitalisation is perhaps best 
described as a succession of supply shocks occurring, and impacting on the economy, over time.

Digitalisation may affect all the contributions to potential output – namely labour, capital and 

TFP. Digital production and supply chains, for example, may raise TFP, because of the greater 
efficiency (in terms of time and/or quality) of digitally-enhanced or digitally-supported 
(e.g. just-in-time) production technology. Digital communication and connectivity may also support 
TFP, by enabling the faster collection and evaluation of data. At the same time, there have been

digitalisation on the economy is available in the box entitled “Digitalisation and its impact on the economy:

suggestions that some digital and mobile communication applications could act as a distraction from 
productive activity. W hile it is unclear how the TFP contribution has been or is going to be affected by 
digital technology, it seems likely that the overall effect would be supportive of potential growth. It is 
also likely that the TFP contribution of digital technologies has been supportive of potential growth in 
the past, although it is noteworthy that this has not been sufficient to offset the decline in trend TFP 
growth. 

While digitalisation may support potential output via the TFP contribution, the effects via the 
contributions from labour and capital are more uncertain. Digital production and supply chains 

may lead to an increased need for labour for non-repetitive, non-routine tasks, digital skills and 
professions, or other skills and professions for the digital work environment (such as openness to 
change and/or adaptability to new technologies). At the same time, however, they may entail a 
reduced requirement for lower skilled labour for more routine tasks and a corresponding shift to more 
(IT) capital. Although these effects might be expected to be broadly offsetting, it is also conceivable 
that the labour contribution to potential output may be pushed up or pulled down somewhat in ways 
that are difficult to predict. The same might be true of the capital contribution. While substantial 
investments in digital technology might be expected, the effect on the overall physical capital stock 
might be limited, particularly if the new technologies increase the intensity with which capital assets 
can be used. 

How the effects of digitalisation on potential output might unfold depends on a number of 

factors, and is therefore difficult to predict. It is noticeable, however, that some economies are 
more advanced than others in certain aspects of digitalisation (see Chart B). Going forward, 
economies with an environment conducive to research and innovation are likely to see faster 
adoption and implementation of digital technologies and thus also a faster impact on potential output.

Summing up, digitalisation is likely to affect potential output and the output gap, but the 
dynamics of those effects are difficult to predict. While the effects of digitalisation on the labour

the TFP contribution are more likely to be supportive of potential output.

Conclusions 

Available estimates indicate that euro area potential growth has increased over 
recent years, although it remains weaker than before the global financial crisis. 

Following a significant slowdown during the crisis, potential growth is estimated to 
have recovered since the start of the ongoing economic recovery. Over recent years, 
potential growth has been underpinned by an expansion of the labour force, a decline 
in trend unemployment and stronger productivity gains. While capital formation has 
also accelerated over recent years, it remains weaker than before the crisis. 

Supply constraints are expected to become increasingly binding going forward, 
which would be conducive to a gradual strengthening of wage growth and 

underlying inflation. During the ongoing economic recovery, real GDP growth has 
consistently exceeded available estimates of potential growth. This has led to a 
gradual shrinking of the output gap that opened up during the crisis. The economy now 
seems to be operating close to its potential. It should be noted, however, that 
estimates of potential output and the output gap are fraught with uncertainty. 

Given the imminent challenges arising from population ageing, well-designed 
structural policies w ith a focus on enhancing productivity are essential to boost 

potential growth. 74 Population ageing is expected to exert downward pressure on 
euro area potential growth over the coming decades. This could be offset at least 
partly by sound structural policies for labour, product and services markets that can be 
expected to raise the labour or TFP contribution to potential growth. To exploit the full 
potential of digitalisation, the euro area economy needs improvements in the quality of 
the digital infrastructure and the availability of digital skills. The deepening of the 
Single Market and competition-enhancing product market reforms, in particular in the 
services sector, would also foster productivity growth. In addition, the cutting of red 
tape would facilitate firm entry and exit and the efficient reallocation of resources 
across firms. Labour force and employment growth could be supported by policies that 
help the long-term unemployed, migrants and other groups whose participation rates 
remain low to enter or return to the labour market, or to find jobs that better match their 
skills.

The state of the housing market in the euro area 

Prepared by Niccolò Battistini, Julien Le Roux, Moreno Roma and 
John Vourdas 

The housing market has important macroeconomic and macroprudential implications 
for the euro area economy. In view of the duration of the ongoing upturn in euro area 
house prices and residential investment, which started at the end of 2013, analysing 
the state of the housing market is particularly informative. This article discusses the 
ongoing housing market upturn, from a chronological and fundamental perspective. It 
also explores a selected set of indicators that can potentially inform on the state of the 
housing market, elaborating on the demand and supply factors underpinning the 
current upturn, as well as their relative importance. 

1 

Introduction 

Understanding and monitoring the state of the housing market is important 
because of its macroeconomic and macroprudential implications. Housing 

market developments affect investment and consumption decisions and can thus be a 
major determinant of the broader business cycle. They also have wealth and collateral 
effects and can thus play a key role in shaping the broader financial cycle. The housing 
market’s pivotal role in the business and financial cycles makes it a regular subject of 
monitoring and assessment for monetary policy and financial stability 
considerations. 75 This is especially relevant given that housing markets can be the 
source of booms and busts, with severe and long-lasting consequences for economic 
and financial development. Such episodes tend to reflect a decoupling of expectations 
over housing market tendencies from their fundamental determinants. 

The housing market has a price and a volume dimension. Residential property 

prices (hereafter “house prices”) and residential investment are relevant dimensions 
and are the main focus of this article. They can be seen, in a broader context, as 
outcomes determined by the interaction of different supply and demand factors. Price 
and volume developments are not necessarily synchronised, so that possible 
misalignments between them can be an additional source of information. However, 
they can also make the overall assessment of the state of the housing market more 
challenging. For the euro area, this assessment is subject to the caveat that there is 
considerable heterogeneity across housing markets and their developments across 
countries. In addition, disentangling developments that could be associated with past 
boom/bust episodes, with a period of accommodative monetary policy or with changes 
in structural factors adds to the complexity of the analysis. 

The state of the housing market is, by nature, unobservable but can be 

assessed from different perspectives. From a chronological perspective, the state 
of the market can be characterised by the length of its upturns or downturns, in 
particular, in comparison with the average durations of such phases. From a

fundamental perspective, it can be assessed by the position of key indicators relative 
to benchmarks, for instance to determine possible house price overvaluation or 
unsustainably high activity in construction. The set of indicators that can potentially 
inform on the state of the housing market is large and the discussion in this article 
therefore needs to be selective. 76 It aims to distinguish broadly between demand and 
supply factors, although even this distinction may be difficult given the nature of some 
of the indicators. 

Against this background, this article has two main sections. Section 2 puts into 
perspective the recent developments in house prices and residential investment in 
relation to the business cycle. Unless otherwise stated, these two indicators are 
expressed in nominal and real terms respectively. Section 3 elaborates on the demand 
and supply factors underpinning the current upturn in the housing market, as well as 
their relative importance.

The state of the euro area housing sector: a look at 
residential investment and house prices 

The upturn in the euro area housing market is in its fourth year. Measured in 

terms of annual growth rates, house prices started to pick up at the end of 2013, while 
the pick-up in residential investment started somewhat later, at the end of 2014. The 
latest available data (first quarter of 2018) indicate annual growth rates above their 
long-term averages (see Chart 1, left-hand panel) for both indicators. This is more 
evident for residential investment (where the upturn in growth rates has levelled off) 
than for house prices (where it has continued). The timing of the start of the upturn is 
broadly the same when measured in terms of the levels of the two indicators. At the 
same time, the level perspective highlights that residential investment is still 
considerably below earlier peaks, while house prices have recovered from the 
declines recorded during the financial crisis (see Chart 1, right-hand panel). In the 
aftermath of the financial crisis, residential investment declined sharply by 25%, 
bottoming out in 2014. Thus far it has only partially recovered and in early 2018 was 
still 15% below its pre-crisis level. House prices, on the other hand, contracted by only 
6% between peak and trough, and in early 2018 were standing 5% above their 
pre-crisis level (although in real terms – deflated by the HICP – they were 5% below 
their pre-crisis level). 

76  In this respect, the article does not discuss some indicators that regularly feature in other assessments of 
the housing market, such as household balance sheet positions. For additional indicators see, for 
instance, “Methodologies for the Assessment of Real Estate Vulnerabilities and Macroprudential 
Policies – Residential Real Estate”, ESRB, forthcoming.

The upturn in the housing market is common to the majority of euro area 

countries. Over the last four years almost all of the countries have witnessed positive 
average growth in both residential investment and house prices, although with 
different magnitudes (see Chart 2). On balance, the majority of the countries share the 
feature, observed for the euro area as a whole, of concurrent growth in investment and 
house prices during the current upturn (blue dots), mirroring the relative adjustments 
in the preceding downturn (yellow dots). Some natural questions arise. How prolonged 
is the current housing market upturn compared with historical regularities? And, what 
can we expect going forward?

A turning point analysis suggests that the housing market upturn is in a 
relatively advanced phase compared w ith the average duration of such upturns. 

ECB Economic Bulletin, Issue 7 / 2018 – Articles 
The state of the housing market in the euro area 

73 

 
 
 
 
From a chronological perspective, at the aggregate euro area level, the length of the 
current upturn in both residential investment and house prices of about 4 years 
amounts to the average duration of historical upturns in residential investment and half 
the duration of historical upturns in house prices (see Table 1). For the purpose of this 
article, an upturn exceeding half the average duration of previous upturns shall be 
considered relatively mature. It should be borne in mind that turning point analysis is 
surrounded by considerable uncertainty, especially at the end of the sample, and that 
there is no unique way of dating the economic phases. Notwithstanding these caveats, 
if we consider the five largest euro area countries, the residential investment cycle has 
reached a mature phase in Germany and the Netherlands, while it is still at an early 
stage in France, Italy and, to a lesser extent, Spain. According to this metric, the house 
price cycle is likewise advanced in Germany, while it is still at a rather preliminary 
stage in the other countries. In Italy, the formal turning point analysis does not yet 
suggest an upturn in house prices. 77 The maturity of the upturn can also be related to 
the strength of the recovery, with more mature cycles generally exhibiting lower rates 
of growth compared with those recorded at an early stage of the cycle. 

The current euro area upturn is stronger than historical averages for residential 
investment but weaker for house prices. If cycles were to evolve around an 

unchanged trend, the relatively strong upturn in residential investment can be related 
to the relatively large fall in the aftermath of the crisis: during the ongoing upturn, euro 
area residential investment has increased at an annual average rate of 3.5%, clearly 
above the average of 1.9% recorded for the same duration in previous upturn phases 
(see Table 1). For euro area house prices, the corresponding comparison suggests a 
relatively muted upturn, with an annual average rate of increase of 2.7% – below the 
historical average of 6.3%. For house prices, this relatively muted pattern is common 
across the largest euro area countries, whereas in the case of residential investment 
the outcomes are mixed: the Netherlands and France exhibited higher than average 
upturns, while the opposite was true for Germany, Spain and Italy. This metric is an 
additional gauge for assessing the state of the housing market, but it comes with the 
caveat that the relative strength of the upturn may look “artificially” low in countries 
where the historical averages are influenced by unsustainable booms in the housing 
market. To this end, assessments against fundamental values are also needed. 

77  A visual inspection of the series would instead suggest a trough around the first quarter of 2015, after 
which house prices have been broadly stable.

Notes: The identification of upturns and downturns is based on real residential investment and real house prices (house prices deflated 
by HICP) using a modified Bry and Boschan (1971) quarterly algorithm (“BBQ”), as in Harding and Pagan (2002). The parameter of 
minimum phase duration set to six quarters, as in Borio and McGuire (2004) and Bracke (2011). Average growth denotes the annual rate 
of change of real residential investment and nominal house prices over the period Q1 1980-Q1 2018. Only completed phases are 
included in the computation of average durations and growth rates. 
(*) In Italy, where house prices have not yet bottomed out, data refer to downturn phases. 

Assessing house prices and residential investment against fundamentals also 
provides insights on the state of the cycle. Chronologies of the housing cycle can 

only provide a partial gauge for assessing the state of the housing market, although, 
empirically, being out of tune with fundamentals often coincided with the state of the 
cycle being relatively more advanced and having seen a relatively strong magnitude of 
adjustment. Benchmarking against fundamentals can take several forms, such as 
simple ratios, deviations from model-explained values, or synthetic combinations of 
such metrics. In the case of house prices, valuation estimates are regularly applied in 
financial stability assessments 78 and currently point to a slight overvaluation for the 
euro area as a whole, as well as for Germany and France (see Chart 3). In the case of 
residential investment, this article introduces a synthetic indicator constructed from 
different (standardised) ratios for output and employment in the construction sector. 
For both the euro area and the largest euro area countries, this indicator suggests that 
the residential investment cycle is close to its historical norm, somewhat above for 
Germany and somewhat below in the case of Italy. 

78  Valuation estimates are surrounded by a high degree of uncertainty, while their interpretation may be 
complicated at the country level, given national specificities like fiscal treatment or structural factors 
(e.g. tenure status). Moreover, developments are heterogeneous not only across countries but in some 
cases across regions within a country. For further discussion, see “Financial Stability Review”, ECB, 
May 2018 and “Monthly Report”, Deutsche Bundesbank, February 2018.

Notes: The synthetic indicator of residential investment activity is a simple average of four indicators (standardised so as to have zero 
mean and unit standard deviation since their earliest available date) and includes (1) residential investment as a share of GDP (both in 
nominal terms), (2) construction employment as a share of total employment, (3) labour shortages from the European Commission 
Survey on construction, and (4) building permits. A high level of the synthetic indicator may be interpreted as high residential investment 
compared with historical standards. The valuation estimates for residential property prices are based on four indicators: the 
price-to-income and price-to-rent ratios, a model-based estimate (Bayesian inverted demand model) and an asset pricing model. For 
further details, see Box 3 in the “Financial Stability Review”, ECB, June 2011, and Box 3 in the “Financial Stability Review”, ECB, 
November 2015.  

Overall, the state of the euro area housing market is relatively mature but is not, 
so far, characterised by disproportionate residential investment activity or 

house price dynamics. The analysis shown in this section suggests more strength 
and maturity in the euro area residential investment cycle than in the house price 
cycle. However, measured against underlying fundamentals, the former does not 
appear, so far, to be above its historical norm. Given that the housing sector can be an 
important driver of the business cycle and that residential investment and house prices 
can have leading indicator properties for future economic activity, the current state 
does not herald imminent risks of a move towards a contraction in the economic cycle 
(see Box 1 for a more detailed analysis). 

Box 1 

The housing market as a predictor of prolonged contractions in economic activity 

Prepared by Niccolò Battistini and John Vourdas 

Fluctuations in the housing market are an important factor affecting business cycle dynamics 

and macroeconomic expectations. 79 While residential investment is a relatively small component 
of the economy (accounting, in nominal terms, for 6% of GDP between the first quarter of 1997 and 
the first quarter of 2018), it exhibits greater volatility than the other expenditure components of GDP. 
Residential investment is an expenditure component in its own right but can also have significant 
implications in terms of consumption expenditures in durable goods as new or refurbished housing is 
equipped. Housing-related decisions tend to be strongly correlated across households, since they are

affected by aggregate variables such as demographic transitions and credit and financing conditions, 
thus acting as an important propagating mechanism of underlying shocks. Consequently, residential 
investment developments can have a wider impact on the economy. In particular, residential 
investment developments have been found to lead developments in GDP, especially before 
recessions. 80 In addition, house price developments have also been found to carry important 
information for subsequent recessions, especially when triggered by exuberant expectations and 
excessive credit growth. This box illustrates how residential investment and house prices can 
contribute to the estimation of short-term probabilities of future prolonged contractions in economic 
activity. 

The specific hypothesis that housing market dynamics can predict prolonged contractions 
can be formally tested on the basis of a panel logit model on euro area data. 81 Following 

Kohlscheen et al. (2018), 82 the panel logit model regresses a binary indicator of a prolonged (at least 
two-quarter) contraction in real GDP occurring within the following four quarters on (1) the slope of the 
yield curve and (2) the number of quarters with a negative quarterly growth rate in the current and the 
previous three quarters of the two housing market indicators of interest. 83 In order to benchmark the 
predictive power of residential investment and house prices, the latter metric is also constructed for 
other GDP components: non-residential investment, total consumption and the trade balance. 84 

The model confirms a statistically significant predictive power of housing market variables 

for future prolonged contractions. All specifications in Table A confirm that the slope of the yield 
curve – except when considered alone in column (1) – provides useful information for forecasting the 
start of a prolonged contraction. 85 Columns (2) and (3) show that residential investment and house 
prices, respectively, significantly increase the predictive power of the model (from 3% to within 
16-18%, broadly in line with the estimates presented in Kohlscheen et al., 2018, with a similar model). 
Furthermore, as shown in column (4) of Table A, including both indicators at the same time further 
improves the predictive power (up to 21%). Columns (5) and (6) show that total consumption has a 
statistically significant predictive power both on its own (as do non-residential investment and the 
trade balance, which are not reported) and when all expenditure components are included in the 
model. The loss of statistical significance by house prices in the latter model may be due to the

81  The sample includes a panel of eight large countries between the first quarter of 1997 and the first quarter 
of 2017. The selection of the countries aimed to identify economically significant estimates from a euro 
area perspective over the last 20 years, thus excluding relatively small countries joining the euro area in 
the late 2000s and (former) programme countries (Ireland, Greece and Portugal). Results for housing 
variables (investment and prices) are robust to the inclusion of the latter countries.

Ev idence from the past five decades”, BIS Working Papers, No 726, 2018. 
83  Several studies have found the yield curve to be the best single predictor of recessions (e.g. Rudebusch, 
G. and W illiams, J., “Forecasting recessions: the puzzle of the enduring power of the yield curve”, Journal 
of Business and Economic Statistics, Vol. 27, 2009, pp. 492-503). However, more recent ev idence has 
questioned the power of the slope of the yield curve as a predictor of prolonged contractions, due to a 
decoupling of future short-term interest rates from their expected path (e.g. Schrimpf, A. and Wang, Q., 
“A reappraisal of the leading indicator properties of the yield curve under structural instability,” 
International Journal of Forecasting, Vol. 26, 2010, pp. 836-857). These dev iations may have stemmed 
from default risk – leading to the steepening of the yield curve before a prolonged contraction – and the 
ensuing implementation of unconventional monetary policies – leading to the flattening of the yield curve 
before a recovery. 
84  Endogeneity is then partially taken into account by the lag difference between the dependent variable 
and the independent variables. 
85  The lack of significance of the slope of the yield curve as a single predictor in column (1) may be due to 
an omitted variable bias, which is then (at least partially) addressed by the introduction of further 
regressors.

Notes: The sample includes a balanced panel with observations over the period Q1 1997-Q1 2017 for Germany, France, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium 
and Finland. The dependent variable is a 0-1 indicator, taking the value of 1 if a prolonged contraction (defined as a quarter belonging to a period of at least two 
consecutive quarters of negative real GDP quarterly growth) occurs at any time in the following four quarters (and 0 otherwise). All independent variables are 
computed as the number of quarters of the negative quarterly growth rate of the respective original variable in the current and the previous three quarters (except 
for the trade balance as a ratio of GDP, for which the quarter-on-quarter change is used in place of the growth rate), except for the slope of the yield curve, which 
is computed as the difference between the ten-year and the three-month government bond yields. House prices are computed as the house price index divided 
by the overall HICP. The logit regressions are based on panel data estimation with fixed effects and standard errors clustered by country. Coefficients represent 
the log odds ratio. Standard errors are in parentheses. Asterisks denote the statistical significance of coefficients at the following confidence levels: *** 1%, ** 5% 
and * 10%. Coefficients for the constant and fixed effects are not reported. 

Model specifications, including housing market variables, do not raise significant concerns 
about the viability of a continued economic expansion over the short term (see Chart A). The 

estimated parameters of the model specification, including the slope of the yield curve, residential 
investment and house prices (column (4) of Table A), are applied to euro area aggregate data 
between the first quarter of 1997 and the first quarter of 2018. It is then possible to generate fitted 
probabilities of four-quarter-ahead prolonged contractions until the first quarter of 2017 – to be 
compared with actual realisations of economic downturns – and forecast probabilities from the 
second quarter of 2017 to the first quarter of 2018 – to produce model-implied predictions. Compared 
with the 30% probability before the financial crisis started in 2008 and the 20% probability before the 
sovereign debt crisis started in 2011, the forecast probability of a prolonged contraction starting within 
the following four quarters is very low (about 3%) in the first quarter of 2018. 87 Importantly, both 
prolonged contractions observed over the past 20 years were preceded by model-implied 
probabilities of at least 20%, although probabilities of the same magnitude were observed that were 
not followed by contractions. 

86  See, e.g. Campbell, J. and Cocco, J., “How do house prices affect consumption? Ev idence from micro 
data”, Journal of Monetary Economics, Vol. 54, 2007, pp. 591-621. 
87  Compared with results from only housing market variables, introducing all variables – as in the model 
reported in column (7) of Table A – would produce comparable results, yielding a lower probability of a 
prolonged contraction (about 30%) before the second quarter of 2008, a higher probability (again, about 
30%) before the fourth quarter of 2011 and a broadly similar probability in the first quarter of 2018 (about 
2%).

Overall, housing market variables significantly contribute to the prediction of imminent 
economic contractions beyond what can be inferred from the slope of the yield curve. At the 

same time, housing market variables alone cannot fully predict future economic contractions and 
other indicators, such as financial variables, may further improve on their predictive power. At the 
current juncture, the analysis presented in this box does not raise significant concerns of an imminent 
economic contraction as a result of housing market dynamics.

Notes: The chart reports the fitted and forecast probabilities of a prolonged contraction in the euro area starting within the following four quarters, based on the 
parameters estimated through the panel logit model, with residential investment and house prices for eight large euro area countries over the period 
Q1 1997-Q1 2017, corresponding to column (3) of Table A. The fitted and forecast probabilities are then obtained by applying the estimated parameters to 
aggregate euro area data for Q1 1997-Q1 2017 and Q2 2017-Q1 2018 respectively. The shaded areas represent prolonged contractions, defined as periods of 
two or more consecutive quarters of negative quarterly real GDP growth.

Supply and demand factors behind the current state of the 
housing market 

House prices and residential investment can be seen, in a broader context, as 
outcomes determined by the interaction of supply and demand factors. Such 
underlying factors can thus shed additional light on the state of the housing market. 
However, corresponding indicators are scarce, often lagging, and are not always easy 
to interpret in terms of whether they provide information unequivocally on the demand 
or the supply side. This section makes a selective approach to discussing some of 
these indicators. 

3.1 

Demand factors 

Consumer survey indicators point to ongoing increases in demand for housing. 

During the current upturn of the housing cycle, the number of respondents intending to 
carry out home improvements and to purchase or build a home has gradually 
increased in the euro area and in the vast majority of euro area countries (see 

ECB Economic Bulletin, Issue 7 / 2018 – Articles 
The state of the housing market in the euro area 

79 

 
 
 
Chart 4). The latest data thus suggest that further demand for housing – related to 
both the stock and the flow (investment) – may still be in the pipeline. For the euro 
area as a whole, the intention to carry out home improvements was close to an all-time 
high in mid-2018, while the intention to purchase or build a home had increased more 
modestly and remained well below pre-crisis peaks. Since housing-related sentiment 
indicators have improved, on balance, more moderately than overall consumer 
confidence, data do not seem to point to a risk of exuberant demand. Intentions to 
purchase or build a home reflect a combination of cyclical and structural factors. Box 2 
discusses homeownership as an example of the latter.

Notes: Data are standardised so as to have zero mean and unit standard deviation from the first quarter of 1999. 

The rising demand for housing has been supported by developments in income 

and financing conditions. The current euro area housing upturn has been 
accompanied by an expansion in real disposable income. In addition, financing 
conditions remained favourable, as reflected in composite bank lending rates for 
house purchase that have declined by more than 130 basis points since 2013 and by 
easing credit standards. This has given rise to a higher demand for loans for house 
purchase and a substantial strengthening in new mortgage lending (see Chart 5). The 
expansion in loans for house purchases net of repayments has been rather moderate 
and thus suggests that the upturn in the housing market came with more moderate 
increases in mortgage indebtedness. However, gross loan origination suggests, at the 
same time, that the actual availability of credit for the purpose of purchasing and 
building houses is more than ample. 88 In this respect, the growth in mortgage loan 
origination in the euro area has been more synchronised with the growth in house 
prices. From a cross-country perspective, loan origination is currently at historical 
highs in Germany and France, close to its historical average in Italy, while it remains 
subdued in Spain.

Housing demand is likely to have been supported also by investment motives. 

The relative attractiveness of housing as an investment class has increased during the 
recent housing upturn. Estimates of the return on housing-related investment are 
surrounded by considerable uncertainty but suggest an increase in the relative 
attractiveness of investment in residential property vis-à-vis alternative asset 
classes – such as government bonds, deposits and equities – since 2013 (see 
Chart 6). 89 Private and institutional investors, both domestically and globally based, 
searching for yield may thus have contributed to additional housing demand. 90 One 
expression of this search is portfolio reallocation and flows into real estate funds, 
which have increased steadily for the euro area as a whole since the beginning of 
2013, also as a share of residential investment (see Chart 7). While too small in terms 
of size to account for substantial shifts in overall demand for real estate properties 
(some of which could also be directed to commercial real estate or outside the euro 
area jurisdictions), these funds can nevertheless indicate additional housing demand 
for investment purposes. 

89  The first estimate – the gross rental yield – is computed as the ratio of actual and imputed rents over the 
gross housing capital stock and is meant to be a broad, macroeconomic measure of rental yield. The 
second estimate of housing return is from the MSCI Quarterly Research Database and reflects 
residential property portfolios for institutional investors. These portfolios are likely to invest predominantly 
in the prime or close-to-prime market, a sector which is likely to have a different dynamic from the entire 
residential market; this estimate is therefore narrower in scope. 
90  See Chapter 3 of the IMF’s Global Financial Stability Report, April 2018, documenting an increase in real 
estate investments by private equity firms and real estate investment trusts in advanced economies. This 
is also supported by the considerable increase in the size of the professionally managed real estate 
investment market globally and in several euro area countries in 2017, with the German market replacing 
China as the fourth largest market globally. For a discussion, see “Real Estate Market Size 2017”, MSCI, 
June 2018.

From a longer-term perspective, the positive cyclical factors of housing 
demand may have been dampened by structural factors such as demographics. 

Since 1995, the decreasing growth rate of the 20-49 population age group, which is an 
important cohort in terms of housing demand, can contribute to explaining the 
declining residential investment share of GDP in the euro area and may have 
exacerbated the sharp cyclical fall in residential investment following the onset of the 
crisis (see Chart 8). Looking ahead, projections of growth in the euro area 20-49 
year-old population bracket suggest a bottoming out of this dampening structural

factor in the coming years, leaving more room for ongoing positive cyclical forces to 
fuel demand for residential investment (as a share of GDP). Over a longer period of 
time, the relationship between the growth rate of the 20-49 population age and 
residential investment is also observed at the country level. 91

Box 2 

Explaining homeownership ratios making use of micro data 

Prepared by Julien Le Roux 

The degree of homeownership can be a structural factor determining housing demand and 

thus house price dynamics. For instance, wealth effects associated with owning a house can 
stimulate economic growth and thereby house prices. Moreover, homeowners can use capital gains 
to “trade up” in the housing market, thus enhancing house price dynamics. The higher the 
homeownership ratio, the more potential there may be for increasing the dynamics, volatility and 
excessiveness of house price dynamics. An indicative although causally not exhausting relationship 
is that existing between the level of the homeownership ratio and the average growth in house prices 
across euro area countries (see Chart A).This box investigates the main determinants of 
homeownership making use of micro data. 

91  Monnet, E., and Wolf, C., “Demographic Cycle, Migration and Housing Investment”, Journal of Housing 
Economics, Vol. 38, 2017, pp. 38-49. At the euro area level, data are only available from 1995, while 
Monnet and Wolf (2017) carried out estimations at the country level from 1980. Highlighting the strong 
cyclicality of the 20-49 year-old population growth rate, they show that housing demand is better 
measured when looking only at the evolution of the age group relevant for household formation, all other 
age groups being held constant.

Notes: Changes in homeownership appear to be a slow-moving process: from 2010 to 2016, the ownership rate decreased from 66.8% to 66.4% at the euro area 
level. Thus, looking only at the level of ownership appears to be still meaningful. 

Results of the Household Finance and Consumption Survey indicate that both 
household-specific and structural characteristics are important drivers of homeownership. 92 

They indicate that the probability of owning the main residence is positively linked to the age of the 
households, to having previously received inheritances, to being married and having children, and to 
net wealth. In addition, households that experienced higher aggregate consumer price inflation in the 
past are more likely to own their home. This also holds when considering aggregate house price 
inflation and can be reconciled with a desire to hedge against inflation and acquire real assets. 
Furthermore, low real mortgage interest rates experienced in the past are also a driver of ownership, 
but only among households that experienced the highest cost of borrowing. All in all, these results are 
broadly consistent with findings in the literature. 93 

Overall, micro data can be usefully employed in the analysis of housing developments, as 
they provide complementary information to macro data. This is typically the case the more house 

price dynamics have been affected by structural factors. While conjunctural factors can be sufficiently 
assessed with aggregate indicators, as presented in Sections 2 and 3 of this article, structural 
characteristics are better explored on the basis of micro data. Among the structural characteristics of 
the housing market is homeownership, a preference that is important to understand for assessing 
housing market prospects. In the coming years, as the population gets older and past experiences of 
macroeconomic conditions move over time, shifts in ownership across countries might occur, 
spawning effects on housing markets. 

92  The Household Finance and Consumption Survey collects household-level data on assets, liabilities, 
income and consumption. The survey is conducted by statisticians and economists from the European 
System of Central Banks and a number of national statistical institutes. The survey took place in 2010 
and 2011 for the first wave and between 2013 and 2015 for the second wave (the third wave is currently 
under way).

and tax regime over the life of each household. Households are finally clustered into quintiles, determined by the degree of past average experiences for the 
different variables. The average marginal effect gives the effect on the probability of the change in explanatory variables: on the top line of the table under Age, 
0.117 means that the probability of owning a house increases by 0.117 for the 40-64 year-old cohort compared with those less than 40 years old.

Supply factors 

This section analyses how the volume of houses has evolved in recent years and the 
extent to which there are factors which constrain housing supply. 

Housing completions in the euro area have remained substantially below their 
average level since the start of monetary union. This indicator can be viewed as a 

measure of the flow of new houses supplied to the market. In Germany and France 
this flow has recently been close to the average levels observed since the start of 
monetary union, whereas in Spain, Italy and, to a lesser extent, the Netherlands it has

remained subdued (see Chart 9). At the same time, the granting of building permits, 
which are a necessary – but not sufficient – condition to building a house, has 
increased more strongly than housing completions in a number of large euro area 
countries. Since it appears that the supply constraints from a lack of building permits 
have been easing, increases in residential investment activity and new housing supply 
may be forthcoming.

Note: Owing to a lack of recent data on housing completions, for the sake of comparability within countries both building permits and 
housing completions refer to the same year in each country, specifically 2017 for Germany and Spain and 2016 for the other countries 
and the euro area aggregate. 

The lack of building permits can be a constraint to housing supply. In central 

locations and cities, especially, the number of issued permits may fall short of actual 
demand due to the scarcity of building land. A relatively low number of permits then 
pose a constraint on the supply of new homes. In central locations, where the 
availability of land is limited, the competition for scarce building permits may be 
aggravated by demand from investors interested in building commercial real estate, 
and who – according to anecdotal evidence – currently seem to have a preference for 
urban areas. However, data limitations prevent firm conclusions from being drawn. 94 
The notion of local supply constraints is supported by a stronger increase in house 
prices in capital cities vis-à-vis the corresponding countries’ average in the current 
housing market upturn. 95 

In the shorter term, housing supply can also be constrained by the time 

required to receive permits. Administrative restrictions – such as the time required 

94  In Germany 43% of the stock of apartments is held by professional commercial landlords (including 
institutional investors) and another 42% by small private landlords; only around 15% is owner-occupied 
(European Public Real Estate Association). Anecdotal evidence suggests an increasing role of 
institutional investors, which are also absorbing the supply of new flats coming onto the market. 
95  For a discussion, see Box 3 entitled “Residential real estate prices in capital cities: a review of trends”, 
Financial Stability Review, ECB, May 2017, which shows that in the second quarter of 2016 the growth in 
house prices in selected euro area cities outpaced the aggregate of the respective national averages by 
3.7 percentage points.

to obtain a building permit – are a major factor affecting the elasticity of housing supply 
in reaction to demand. 96 Consequently, when demand for housing picks up, one 
would expect it to show initially in a relatively larger rise in house prices than in 
quantities, as measured by residential investment. To illustrate this point, in 2017 a 
construction company needed roughly 126 days to obtain a building permit in 
Germany, compared with 228 days in Italy and 208 days in Spain (see Chart 10).

Note: The euro area aggregate is a weighted average (using GDP weights) of 18 euro area countries (data for Malta are not available). 

Another factor that may have limited housing supply is a shortage of labour in 

construction production. Survey data on the percentage of construction firms 
signalling constraints on production due to a lack of workers suggest that labour 
shortages have started to become an issue in the current housing market upturn. The 
percentage of companies reporting labour as a factor limiting production recorded a 
fourfold increase in the euro area over the past three years, from almost 5% in the third 
quarter of 2015 to more than 20% in the third quarter of 2018 (see Chart 11). Among 
the five largest euro area economies, these developments were more accentuated in 
Germany, France and the Netherlands. 

96  Besides land regulation and a number of other factors like construction costs, credit availability, the 
weather, etc., different spatial factors and historical patterns are also found to affect housing supply 
elasticities. For instance, the distribution of pre-existing land uses matters for local and aggregate supply 
elasticities, as shown by Ball, M., Meen, G. and Nygaard, C., “Housing supply price elasticities revisited: 
Ev idence from international, national, local and company data”, Journal of Housing Economics, 
Vol. 19(4), 2010, pp. 255-268.

Notes: A number of the observations are negative due to seasonal adjustment of the data. These observations are shown to illustrate the 
true evolution of labour shortages. 

Labour shortages may affect the prices in the housing market in different ways. 

On the one hand, shortages may lead to gradually higher wages in the construction 
sector, which, in a situation of sufficient demand, will then be passed through to 
construction output prices. On the other hand, shortages may constrain or delay the 
supply of new houses in relation to demand and then imply a rise in house prices that 
does not necessarily come with higher construction output prices. Thus far, the 
marked rise in construction costs since 2014 has been increasingly fuelled by rising 
labour costs (despite their lower weight in the overall index), indicating growing labour 
shortages, and has been accompanied by strong momentum in house price growth, 
signalling buoyant demand (see Chart 12).

3.3 

The relative importance of housing demand and supply 

Assessing the relative importance of housing demand and supply factors is 
intrinsically challenging, as data mainly refer to equilibrium outcomes. For 

example, rising house prices may reflect an increase in demand for housing or a 
reduced supply of houses. With this caveat in mind, this subsection reviews available 
survey evidence and model-based results to assess the relative contribution of supply 
and demand factors to the state of euro area housing markets. 

Survey data point to an increasing relative importance of supply factors in 
determining the dynamics of prices and investment in the housing market. The 

proportion of construction firms 97 indicating constraints to their production has 
hovered between 50% and 60% since 2014. However, the composition between 
reported demand-side and supply-side constraints has varied significantly: the share 
of firms reporting insufficient demand as a factor limiting production has decreased 
substantially, with opposite developments for firms reporting supply-side constraints 
(see Chart 13). Recently, there has been approximately a 10-percentage point 
increase in the number of respondents noting supply-side rather than demand-side 
constraints limiting production. This suggests that constraints on construction 
producers’ output have recently mainly come from the supply side. This evidence is 
confirmed through the lenses of a stylised model with residential investment and 
house prices (see Box 3). 

97  The European Commission’s Construction Survey sample also includes firms that operate in commercial 
real estate and civil engineering. However, as the factors affecting output in the residential construction 
sector are similar to those affecting the construction sector as a whole, the survey is informative of factors 
affecting production in the residential real estate sector.

Notes: Demand refers to the percentage of respondents noting insufficient demand as a factor limiting production. Supply refers to the 
percentage of respondents reporting neither insufficient demand nor no constraints (i.e. one hundred minus the percentage of 
respondents reporting no constraints minus the percentage of respondents reporting insufficient demand). 

The relative importance of housing demand and supply factors can also be 
assessed by means of information concerning the composition of house 

prices. The more demand outpaces supply, the more prices of existing dwellings 
should be expected to rise as the competition for housing extends to existing 
properties. Whether the prices of existing dwellings rise faster than those of new 
dwellings also naturally depends on whether there are bottlenecks in the supply of 
new dwellings and on the responsiveness of construction output prices. It is thus 
conceivable that the prices of existing dwellings reach a larger amplitude at the peaks 
of the cycle compared with the prices of new dwellings. Indeed, over recent years, the 
contribution of prices of existing dwellings to overall house price growth has risen 
sharply, from close to 10% at the start of the upturn in 2014 to almost 80% in 2016, 
hovering above 70% – but on a declining path – over the last year (see Chart 14). At 
the same time, the increase in the contribution of prices of new dwellings since late 
2016 (although still subdued) may confirm a tightening housing market, with 
increasingly binding supply-side constraints: amid buoyant housing demand, new 
dwellings cannot be provided fast enough and their prices tend to rise more rapidly.

The analysis presented in this section suggests an increasing role for 
supply-side constraints in determining dynamics in the euro area housing 

market. During the early stage of the upturn, a significant positive adjustment in 
residential investment was accompanied by relatively smaller house price increases. 
Over the most recent quarters, as the upturn in the housing market continues, buoyant 
demand amid increasing supply constraints has been associated with moderating 
residential investment growth and continued rising growth in house prices. 

Box 3 

The relative importance of demand and supply factors in driving housing market 
developments 

Prepared by Kyriacos Lambrias 

Individual indicators of demand and supply factors can be inconclusive about their relative 
importance in driving residential investment and house prices. This relative importance can be 

better captured, assessed and quantified through the lenses of economic models. This box presents 
a rather stylised, two-variable Bayesian Vector Auto-Regression (BVAR) model with residential 
investment and house prices. The relative importance of supply and demand factors is assessed by 
identifying demand and supply shocks and by measuring their relative contribution in driving 
fluctuations in these two variables. This practice – typically referred to as historical decomposition – is 
rather standard in the empirical economics literature. Shocks are identified by imposing (sign) 
restrictions to the reaction of the underlying variables in response to these shocks: a demand shock 
leads to a positive co-movement between residential investment and house prices, and a supply 
shock to a negative co-movement. 98 Naturally, this identification restriction is rather general and 

98  Restrictions are imposed for four periods (one year).

encompasses a rather broad range of “demand shocks” and “supply shocks” but illustrates a 
possibility to disentangle supply and demand “forces”, broadly defined. 99 

In the interpretation of the model, demand is the main driver of aggregate movements in the 

housing market. The relative importance can be assessed in terms of “forecast error variance 
decomposition”, where demand shocks explain approximately 65% of the movements in residential 
investment and as much as 80% of those in house prices. 

Consistent w ith the overall dominance of demand factors in driving the housing cycle, model 
evidence suggests that demand buoyancy has more than compensated for lacklustre supply 

in the housing sector over the last few years. On the volume side, residential investment growth 
has been growing positively and above average since the third quarter of 2015. According to the 
BVAR model, during this period residential investment growth has been supported by both supply and 
demand shocks, turning positive following a long period of subdued demand that dates back to the 
Great Recession (see Chart A, left-hand panel). On the price side, house prices have been increasing 
above average since 2016. As with the volume side, this reflects primarily a strong positive 
contribution from demand factors, which turned positive, having persistently contributed to lower 
house prices since the second quarter of 2008 (see Chart A, right-hand panel). Strong demand over 
this period has outweighed positive supply-side developments that have otherwise contributed to 
lower house-price growth. Finally, focusing on developments over this last year, the relative 
contribution of supply factors to both residential investment and house-price growth has been steadily 
decreasing, whereas the relative importance of demand factors has increased. This evidence is 
consistent with the presence of increasing supply-side bottlenecks and demand-side momentum 
behind the expansion of the housing cycle at the current juncture.

Notes: Supply and demand shocks refer to shocks to euro area real residential investment and house prices identified through sign restrictions in a Bayesian 
Vector Auto-Regression (BVAR) model with four lags and Minnesota priors. The series are demeaned. The house price series is seasonally adjusted. 

99  For example, the broad category of demand shocks in the context of this simple model would also include 
monetary policy shocks and government spending shocks, e.g. incentives to families to buy a house. 
Supply shocks, on the other hand, would encompass, inter alia, oil-price shocks, which would contribute 
to higher production costs, as well as labour-supply shocks, e.g. changes in collective agreements 
between employers and trade unions active in the sector. A more elaborate model would be needed to 
further disentangle these broadly defined categories.

Conclusions 

The euro area housing market has been in an upturn since the end of 2013 and 
is in a relatively advanced state of the cycle in terms of duration. House prices 

have surpassed their pre-crisis peaks, while residential investment is still significantly 
below. The state of the euro area housing market is, so far, not characterised by 
generalised investment activity or house price levels above their fundamentals. 
However, considerable heterogeneity in developments across and within countries 
makes the overall assessment more challenging. 

The housing market upturn is expected to continue but at a more moderate 

pace. This reflects expectations in currently available forecasts and projections that 
the euro area economic expansion will continue, reflecting the favourable impact of 
the very accommodative stance of monetary policy, improving labour market 
conditions and stronger balance sheets. This context generates income and financing 
conditions conducive to housing demand. Lending to households for house purchase 
is also expected to remain dynamic in the coming years. Nevertheless, in line with the 
expected slowdown in the pace of economic activity, the rate of expansion in the 
housing market is also expected to moderate. A moderation in residential investment 
might also emerge from the increasing presence of supply-side constraints in some 
euro area countries, which may currently be more binding than in the respective 
economies as a whole. These constraints could however mitigate the envisaged 
moderation in house prices. 

Monitoring a broad set of housing-related indicators is key to assessing the 
macroeconomic and macroprudential implications of the housing market. To 

fully assess the state of the housing market it is necessary to look at both the major 
demand and supply determinants and their interactions. Moreover, given the extended 
interactions between real and financial variables, a broader set of indicators – some of 
which were discussed in this article – that goes beyond house prices and residential 
investment (such as loan developments, house price valuation, household balance 
sheets, etc.) should be continuously monitored to fully understand the macroeconomic 
and macroprudential implications of the ongoing housing upturn.
