# Sentiment Analysis of Economic Reports Using Logistic Regression

Sentiment analysis is a hot topic in NLP, but this technology is increasingly relevant in the financial markets - which are in large part driven by investor sentiment.

With so many reports and economic bulletins being generated on a daily basis, one of the big challenges for policymakers is to extract meaningful information in a short period of time to inform policy decisions.

In this example, two reports from the European Central Bank website (eb201806.en.pdf and eb201807.en.pdf) are converted into text format, and then a logistic regression is used to rank keywords by positive and negative sentiment.
